On October 2 I led an informal workshop for Northeastern English Graduate students about the process of applying for fellowships to support their research and/or teaching. These are some links I thought they might find useful in the fellowship discovery and application process:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/gsas/fellowships/external-funding.html">List of external funding sources</a> from Brandeis University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</li>
<li><a href="http://guides.library.jhu.edu/content.php?pid=26252&sid=1712121">Guide to humanities grants and fellowships</a> from the Johns Hopkins University Libraries</li>
<li><a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/asis/grapes/search.asp">Graduate and Postdoctoral Extramural Support</a> database from UCLA's Graduate Division</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/images/stories/pdfs/scholarly_pursuits.pdf"><em>Scholarly Pursuits: A Guide to Professional Development During the Graduate Years</em></a> by Cynthia Verba</li>
</ul>

In addition, I'm happy to provide <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/67wplxhfzcj5q0u/Cordell-RBSMellon-Application.zip?dl=0">my application materials</a> for the <a href="http://www.rarebookschool.org/fellowships/mellon/">Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship of Scholars in Critical Bibliography</a> at the Rare Book School.
