While reading Christopher Blackwell and Thomas R. Martin's article <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000024/000024.html">Technology, Collaboration, and Undergraduate Research</a> in preparation for Rebecca Frost-Davis and Kathryn Tomasek's Bootcamp at <a href="http://lac2011.thatcamp.org/05/12/suggested-readings-for-bootcamp-1-integrating-digital-humanities-projects-into-the-undergraduate-curriculum/">THATCamp LAC</a>, I came across the following claims: "citation is not a pre-digital anti-plagiarism technology, or at least it should not be in a wholesome intellectual environment. Citation is a pre-digital equivalent to the hyperlink, a way of continuing an ongoing conversation in print, a pathway back from the authorâ€™s current words, to previous comments on the topic at hand."</p> 
<P>I wish I could broadcast this idea into the minds of all my colleagues. As Director of Writing-Across-the-Curriculum at St. Norbert College, I deal quite a bit&mdash;in workshops, in private meetings with professors, and in the Writing Center&mdash;with concerns about citation. These concerns nearly always circle back, not to <em>why we cite</em>, but to <em>the horrors of not citing properly</em>. Folks want to talk about how we can catch plagiarists, rather than how we can train scholars. In other words, the conversations are usually punitive, and rarely pedagogical. I know this is a constant struggle for writing program directors, but the way Blackwell and Martin frame the issue seems to me perfect. I plan to use this quote liberally in future workshops and consultations.</p>
