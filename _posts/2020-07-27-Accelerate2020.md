## Session 1: Zines 

We will be looking at these zines together during the first session. As you look at them, reflect on these questions:

1. Based on this example, what do you imagine a "zine" is?
2. How does this look like a zine to you? (or how does it not) How does it resemble other media you've encountered or use regularly?
3. What is it like to read a zine about cell phones? Activism? Water bears? 

### Activism Zines

1. [Cell Phones Suck! Against the Use of Cellular Technology](https://merrick.library.miami.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/zines/id/1865/rec/13) from the [University of Miami digitized zine collection](https://merrick.library.miami.edu/cdm/search/collection/zines)
2. [This is it (I’m Showing Up)](https://issuu.com/margotterc/docs/this_is_it__i_m_showing_up_) by Margot Terc from the [POC Zine Project](https://poczineproject.tumblr.com/)
3. [Resistance in the Street](https://toleratedindividuality.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/resistance-in-the-street.pdf) from [Activist Journey’s Anarchist/Socialist Zine Library](https://activistjourneys.wordpress.com/bank-of-ideas/)

### Science Zines

1. [Meeting a Giant Octopus](https://smallsciencecollective.tumblr.com/post/86326919094/meeting-a-giant-octopus-by-chen-duo-small-science) by Anon. from the [Small Science Zine Library](https://asyang.wixsite.com/small-science/creatures-zines)
2. [The Indomitable Water Bear](https://smallsciencecollective.tumblr.com/post/85690130054/the-indomidable-water-bear-by-alex-chitty-small) by Alex Chitty from the [Small Science Zine Library](https://asyang.wixsite.com/small-science/creatures-zines)

## Session 2: Twine

In the second session today, we'll experiment with [Twine](http://twinery.org/), "an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories." The term "non-linear" stories is a broad one, and so some folks think of Twine as a platform for making electronic literature, while others consider it a platform for making games (while others question that distinction). Twine was used most famously to map out the story for the ["Bandersnatch" episode](https://www.wired.com/story/black-mirror-bandersnatch-interactive-episode/) of _Black Mirror_. Volume Three of the _Electronic Literature Collection_, which I often teach from in my classes, includes four Twine pieces:

*   _[Quing's Quest VII](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=quings-quest-vii)_
*   [_With Those We Love Alive_](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive)
*   [_The Hunt for the Gay Planet_](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=hunt-for-the-gay-planet)
*   [_Kuryokhin: Second Life_](http://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=kuryokhin)

You can use Twine online or download the application for your computer. Allison Parrish's [A Quick Twine (2.2+) Tutorial](http://catn.decontextualize.com/twine/) is a great introduction to the platform and some basic macros and variables that can extend the platform's capabilities. We will refer to it throughout today's session.

I've also prepared a basic Twine interpretation of the first chapter of the nineteenth-century novel, _Moby_ _Dick ([Loomings.html](/documents/Loomings.html)_, which you can open in your browser and view _or_, more usefully, import into Twine so you can see how it is set up. If you download the HTML file (right click the link --> "Save As" to save the file to your computer), you can use the "Import from file" option within Twine to investigate the story's structure. This is a pretty simple Twine structure, though I did try to build in a few macros that track, for instance, which pages a user has visited before allowing them to move on in the text.

During our activity, you will make a basic Twine narrative (your own, or an adaptation of an existing text) that will ideally comprise:

1.  Several distinct passages
2.  Some narrative branching
3.  Two examples of embedded media (images, video, etc.)
4.  At least one use of the `<<textbox>>` macro

If you'd like to experiment with more advanced Twine programming, feel free to experiment with incorporating other macros, variables, and/or functions into your Twine narrative. Allison Parrish's [A Quick Twine (2.2+) Tutorial](http://catn.decontextualize.com/twine/) introduces several of these advanced features, and she links to a fuller list in [the SugarCube documentation](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/).

If you'd like to see a more complex Twine story than my _Moby Dick_ example, check out [this student project](/documents/IsThisABook.html) from a class this summer.
