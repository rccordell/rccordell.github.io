<em>Cross-posted from my "Hawthorne's Celestial Railroad: A Publication History" development blog at http://ryan.cordells.us/crr/crr-comparison-sets-on-juxta-web/</em><br>
<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/on-the-juxta-beta-release-and-taking-collation-online/">Juxta released a new beta</a> that brings the wonderful textual collation software online, allowing users to upload their comparison sets for others to see. I&#8217;ve been playing with the software for a few months as a beta tester, and I&#8217;m excited to be able to share some of the most significantly edited versions of &#8220;The Celestial Railroad.&#8221;. You can view the complete comparison set at <a href="http://juxta.performantsoftware.com/shares/4ea02e611ca74cf0917e467b33010fdb/view?mode=heatmap&amp;base=1104">http://juxta.performantsoftware.com/shares/4ea02e611ca74cf0917e467b33010fdb/view?mode=heatmap&amp;base=1104</a>.  Check out some of my favorite comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//juxta.performantsoftware.com/shares/4ea02e611ca74cf0917e467b33010fdb/view?mode=sidebyside&amp;docs=1104,1109">The original <em>Democratic Review</em> printing and the American Sunday School Union&#8217;s &#8220;A Visit to the Celestial City&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://juxta.performantsoftware.com/shares/4ea02e611ca74cf0917e467b33010fdb/view?mode=sidebyside&amp;docs=1104,1110">The original <em>Democratic Review</em> printing and the Adventists&#8217; tract edition in the <em>Bible Examiner</em> series</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to the continued development of Juxta&#8217;s web service. In particular, I hope they develop a way for scholars to embed the tool in their project sites. I would love for visitors to this website to access my comparison sets directly.</p>
