****

This fall I taught a mostly-remote version of one of my favorite classes, the honors seminar "Building a (Better) Book" (BBB). You can read more about the class and this assignment in my previous post with project examples from this same class in Summer 2020, [see this previous post](https://ryancordell.org/teaching/bbb-student-book-demos/). The main difference between Summer and Fall 2020 was that in the latter we were able to hold a few carefully staged in-person labs—as when students visited the press using individual appointments over the course of one day—and a handful of students were able to use press resources in their final projects. 

## Meghan

You just have to check out Meghan's player piano project—it's an incredible artist's book, well conceived from design to prose to execution.

## Sarah

Sarah made her own paper mold and used it to hand make the paper for her book in plastic tubs in her dorm room. This would be a remarkable project in any semester but seems especially remarkable in the unique circumstances of pandemic 2020.

## Emma

I loved the playfulness, grounded in research, evidenced by Emma's project.

## Corrine

Corrine was unable to share a presentation, but in some ways that might be better, because it will allow you to explore [the _Groundhog Day_-style murder mystery she wrote in Twine](/documents/Corrine-BBB-Fall2020-BookProject.html) without too much prompting. You may need to consult some [images from the accompanying physical journal](https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/tree/master/img/Corrine-BBB-Fall2020-JournalImages) Corrine made as you play/read. 


## Conclusions

I hope these presentations give a flavor of the work that students do in "Building a (Better) Book." I am so grateful to each of them for begin willing to share their work. I also can't wait to be back together in person, welcoming you all again to community print events and classes at Huskiana.
