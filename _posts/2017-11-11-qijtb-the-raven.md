### OA Statement

I'm very pleased that an article expanding on my previously-posted conference presentation/blog post, ["'Q i-jtb the Raven': Taking Dirty OCR Seriously,"](http://ryancordell.org/research/qijtb-the-raven-mla/) appears in the 2017 issue of *Book History*, which can be found [in full via Project Muse](http://muse.jhu.edu/issue/37341). Thanks to Johns Hopkins University Press' generous OA policies—

—I am able to make the article available here. The *Book History* version thickens the core argument of the original talk and substantially expands its critical bibliography of the [November 28, 1849 *Lewisburg Chronicle, and the West Branch Farmer*](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85055199/1849-11-28/ed-1/seq-1/) and its investigations into the long history behind *Chronicling America*.

### Related Work

Given the workings of academic publishing, a number of articles have come out since I submitted the final draft of "Q i-jtb the Raven" to *Book History* that are directly pertinent to my argument and would, given different timing, be cited and discussed in it. I would call particular attention to two pieces published in *Victorian Periodicals Review*, Katherine Bode's ["Fictional Systems: Mass-Digitization, Network Analysis, and Nineteenth-Century Australian Newspapers"](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/652588) (*VPR* 50.1, Spring 2017) and Paul Fyfe's ["An Archaeology of Victorian Newspapers"](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezproxy.neu.edu/article/644183) (*VPR* 49.4, Winter 2016) and especially to Bode's ["The Equivalence of 'Close' and 'Distant' Reading; Or, Towards a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History"](http://mlq.dukejournals.org/content/78/1/77.abstract) (*Modern Language Quarterly*, December 2017), which Bode also [makes available on her website](https://katherinebode.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/equivalence1.pdf). If you find the argument in "Q i-jtb the Raven" interesting or useful, you will benefit from Bode's and Fyfe's work as well.
