Last Thursday <a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/english/faculty/Rybak.asp">Chuck Rybak</a>, a colleague from UWGB, read some of his poetry at the St. Norbert College English Discipline's literary awards event. His poetry was wonderful: honestly attentive to the small realities of adult life, and often genuinely funny—which is not a phrase we get to apply to poetry often enough.

One of Chuck's poems, however, stood out as something the digital humanities community would enjoy. It's a remix of John Keats using CAPTCHA words. The result is absurd but funny and oddly insightful into our lives on the web. I asked Chuck if I could share it, and he generously sent it to me and said to consider it "open source."

I hope you enjoy as much as I did:<br />
<blockquote><strong>John Keats, Asked to Type in a Word Verification, Fears That He May Cease to Be</strong>

When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before I’ve typed doedwat or sesessto,
Before high-plahsi closps, in preaderi,
Hold like rich cuchcomb the full mittaloo;
When I behold, upon the hork’s starred bushmer,
Huge woresmick caties of a high grubnit,
And think that I may never live to kaxber
Their mearshmee, with the nullfu hand of squilt;
And when I feel, fair saphan of a fuggi,
That I shall never boxynalp thee more,
Never have cocta in the valoggi
Of vocutebob love—then on the splnor
Of the wide whiza I stand oovicks, and think,
Till flesh and blood to cursorness do sink.
