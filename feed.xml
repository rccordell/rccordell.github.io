As you will see, I went in a slightly different direction between my abstract and the actual roundtable.</p> <hr/> <p>At the 2011 MLA, Stephen Ramsay delivered a provocation in the “History and Future of Digital Humanities” panel. He began by noting that “with only three minutes…you can’t do much of anything except piss off half the people in the room,” and <a href="https://search.credoreference.com/articles/Qm9va0FydGljbGU6MzM5MDMwMA==?aid=107224">a single line from Stephen’s talk</a> not only pissed off people in the room but became <em>the</em> bogeyman of the great DH debates:</p> <blockquote> <p>Do you have to know how to code? I’m a tenured professor of digital humanities and I say “yes”.</p> </blockquote> <p>The way this line was excerpted and sound-bitten and outrage farmed still upsets me—even in this compressed form, if you read just the next few lines it’s clear Ramsay was talking about how DH practice differed by program and institution. But I can’t unpack that history in the four minutes I have left.</p> <p>Instead, I want to focus on <a href="https://search.credoreference.com/articles/Qm9va0FydGljbGU6MzM5MDMwMQ==?aid=107224">Ramsay’s followup</a>, where he posited making as “a new kind of hermeneutic” common among the many strands of DH work, from coding to building digital editions to mapping to network analysis. Under this more capacious framework, one codes to inculcate richer engagement with software—not as a consumer only, but as a practitioner who understands the infrastructure and labor—both intellectual and technical—that enable software to function.</p> <p>Which leads me to <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3403038/darnton_historybooks.pdf">Darnton’s “communications circuit”</a> and perhaps the most famous diagram in humanities scholarship:</p> <p><img src="https://typeset.io/figures/figure-1-robert-darnton-the-communications-circuit-1982-115kv9b3.webp" alt=""/></p> <p>This depiction of book production has been much debated, amended, and rebutted—including by Darnton himself—but the key insight which arguably launched the field of book history was that understanding books requires an <em>infrastructural</em> perspective that includes not only authors and editors but the laborers whose craft and technical expertise carried texts to readers. Book history argues that interpreting only the words inside books obfuscates or erases many of their political, economic, environmental, and cultural meanings.</p> <p>While Darnton directed scholars’ attention to compositors and printers and book binders, we could look further backward, to the private press and <a href="https://www.redalyc.org/journal/6943/694373001007/html/">bibliographical press movement</a>, to find scholar-practitioners who advocated for hands-on experience with bookish technologies. We can talk more about these movements in the Q&amp;A, but I will over-simplify and claim that they largely responded to the <em>industrialization</em> of textual production, and largely focused on one end of the spectrum of print culture: the careful production of highest quality books through elite craftspersonship.</p> <p>In 2024, we find ourselves in the midst of a new book lab movement, led by scholars from book history and—tellingly—digital humanities. Last year we published <a href="https://works.hcommons.org/records/mnzk3-j8m82">a whitepaper studying the growth of “humanities maker spaces,”</a> many of which are bookish in focus; the Rare Book School now <a href="https://rarebookschool.org/courses/library/l140v/">runs a regular course</a>, taught by Matthew Kirschenbaum and Kari Krauss, about building such programs; and <a href="https://rarebookschool.org/courses/library/l140v/">a recent call for a symposium on the subject</a> received so many applications we are scrambling to expand the event.</p> <p>While these new labs share family resemblances with earlier movements, I would argue they respond to the <em>digitization</em> and <em>algorithmization</em> of culture. In <em>Writing Machines</em>, N. Katherine Hayles argues that early twenty-first century literary criticism was “shot through with unrecognized assumptions specific to print” that only began “clearly coming into view” as electronic texts cast the mediation of print in sharp relief (30). Accordingly, today’s book labs emphasize material engagement and hands-on labor across a wider variety of media and texts—e.g. posters, postcards, bookmarks, broadsides, zines—and focus more on tactile experience than producing flawless prints.</p> <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsHXNj5PdQy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style=" background:#FFF;

Like Ramsay argued of DH in 2011, teachers and students in book labs find “that this process of creation yields insights that are difficult to acquire otherwise”—that <em>making</em> a book, or a poster, or a pamphlet, “is an entirely different experience” from reading one. Importantly, the materiality of that experience illuminates in two directions: making the technologies, materials, and laborers of historical communications circuits more visible, yes, but always pointing—by comparison or contrast—to the “full stack” of technical systems that underly our own historical moment.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHGZ2Ju6MXY">Alan Liu has asked</a>, “what kind of cultural criticism is uniquely appropriate and purposive for the digital humanities?” a question he answers with “the critical study of infrastructure.” It is here where I see the most opportunity for cooperation between digital humanities and book history, as DH scholars seek to more consciously interrogate the social, political, and economic underpinnings of contemporary technical systems and BH scholars wrestle with the complex materiality of computational systems and cultures. Both projects will require us to get building. Do we need need more digital humanists setting type and more book historians coding? I’m a tenured professor of something or other, and I say “yes.”</p>]]></content><author><name>Ryan Cordell</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The following are my brief remarks for the ACH’s MLA 2025 roundtable on “Book History and the Digital Humanities.”.

While the past decade has seen a rapid growth of spaces dedicated to hands-on experimentation and teaching with historical technology, humanistic media, and related approaches, the humanities makerspace movement has not been well studied as a movement, or a community.</p> <p>We summarize the goal of the SHMLM study as:</p> <blockquote> <p>SHMLM analyzes the humanities’ maker turn by surveying the research, pedagogical, and public service missions of existing humanities makerspaces; identifying commonalities among such efforts across disciplines, technologies, and organizational structures; comparing their activities and institutional identities with comparable contemporary STEM- or arts-focused makerspaces. This project lays the groundwork for more robust communication and professionalization among such initiatives, building shared resources about the impact of humanities makerspaces that can be used for organization, advocacy, and fund-raising by scholars building and sustaining such programs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Our whitepaper, “Surveying the Humanities MakerLab Movement,” is <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:69557/">now published at Humanities Commons</a>.

Wanted—a mechanical curiosity, with brain and fingers; a thing that will set up so many type a day—a machine that will think and act, but still a machine; a being who takes the most systematic and monotonous drudgery—yet one that the ingenuity of man has never supplanted, mechanically; that’s a printer.” This article, which imagines a printer as an intelligent machine, <a href="https://github.com/ViralTexts/gtr-clusters/blob/main/clusters/18600105-sn84026845-WantedAPrinter.md">was reprinted in at least 91 newspapers</a> across the United States between 1860 and 1892. In the US at this time, newspaper content was explicitly not protected by intellectual property law, and editors swapped papers for common use through what were called “exchanges.” In the United States, editors took advantage of favorable postal rates to trade their papers with each other for reciprocal use. Compositors filled daily, weekly, or more occasional issues with selections from the other newspapers on their exchange lists, as well as from the magazines, books, and other media that their editors sifted through for content. The hybridity of the nineteenth-century paper reflects their diverse sources. A piece like “Wanted—A Printer” jostled for attention on the same page as short or serialized fiction; poetry, alongside hard news; travel and general interest pieces; practical information and advice; jokes, anecdotes, and miscellaneous facts; domestic, philosophical, and spiritual advice; and opinion alongside sometimes trite, sometimes profound aphorisms. Like a twenty-first century social media feed, the newspaper was a single medium for nearly every genre of content, often presented without evident organization.</p> <p>This text is typical of the selections we discover through the <em>Viral Texts</em> project, which I co-founded with David Smith at Northeastern University eight years ago and continue to work on at the University of Illinois. I will not belabor a discussion of our text mining methods today, but for those curious we link to several articles on our website at <a href="https://viraltexts.org">https://viraltexts.org</a> that describe these methods in detail, as does chapter two of our book in progress, which is <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/going-the-rounds">available in draft form from the University of Minnesota Press</a>. In brief, we have developed a suite of tools for fuzzy duplicate-text detection to identify clusters of likely-reprinted texts in digitized collections of historical newspapers. Growing from early experiments on pre-Civil War American newspapers held in the Library of Congress’ <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Chronicling America</a> collection, <em>Viral Texts</em> now mines data from more than 20 large-scale historical periodicals archives, including papers from North America, Europe, and Australia and from the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. We use this data to explore different facets of nineteenth-century periodical culture, from the popular genres and authors that primarily circulated through newspaper reprinting, to the topics that generated the most discourse in the paper, to the ways reprinting can help us understand the flow of information across the country in the period.</p> <p>In this talk, I seek to connect this messy textual ecosystem to twenty-first textual technologies such as large language models, such as ChatGPT. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/bh.2023.a910951">In a 2023 <em>Book History</em> article</a>, Sarah Bull links the rise of “book-making” in the nineteenth century, as a category separate from authorship, to “the birth of the content generator” and, eventually, the ideas of textual content that underlie twenty-first century technologies like LLMs. By separating “two discrete categories of labor, the intellectual/creative and the bodily/mechanical,” Bull argues, nineteenth-century writers, editors, and publishers “popularized the idea that all text and anything that could be rendered into text was content—alienable filler for a medium, in this case, the book—and that this material could be generated pretty much automatically.”<sup id="fnref:Bull" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Bull" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I will argue that the newspaper exchange system offers a similar analog, as a method of textual production founded on the selection, adaptation, and recontextualization of existing prose and poetry.</p> <p>As most newspapers were produced in small, local print shops by a few compositors and editors, that text was processed by the very “machine that will think and act, but still a machine” cited in my opening example. If we consider the full network of papers that constituted the exchange system—and the millions of densely-composed pages being exchanged through it each year—the nineteenth-century newspaper constituted perhaps the largest text generation platform in human history, and it offers both lessons and warnings for our current discussions of large language models. Like LLMs, nineteenth-century newspapers blended original and unoriginal writing in ways that were difficut for their readers to immediately apprehend, and that reality led to similar—and warranted—anxieties about veracity, attribution, and reliability to what we face today.</p> <h3 id="ii-scissors--paste-pots">II. Scissors &amp; Paste Pots</h3> <p>Nineteenth-century newspaper editors frequently discussed their exchanges and the importance of reprinting to their medium. For instance, on <a href="https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn84024516/1888-06-06/ed-1/seq-2/">June 6, 1888</a>, the editor of Raleigh, North Carolina’s <em>News &amp; Observer</em> praised the new woodcut adorning the front page of a neighboring paper from Durham. “We have the <em>Daily Tobacco Plant</em>,” they wrote, “with a beautifully engraved colored head piece in which appropriately appear the scissors and the paste pot and which makes it the handsomest daily in America, so far as we know, or for that matter the world.” <a href="https://newspapers.digitalnc.org/lccn/sn91068306/1888-06-05/ed-1/seq-1/">Looking at the <em>Daily Tobacco Plant</em></a>, we see the details praised by the <em>News &amp; Observer</em>: to the left, the editor’s ink-pot and quill sit atop a pile labeled “clippings”; the editor’s scissors run across the page, their handle looped through the capital “D” in “Daily”; while the paste-pot sits on the other side, waiting to paste up chosen clippings, so the paper’s compositors can set them in type for reprinting. By noting that these icons “so appropriately appear” as the headpiece for a daily newspaper, the <em>News &amp; Observer</em> highlights the material reality of newspaper production across much of the US during the period, which comprised primarily reprinted material from other newspapers, rather than original writing, and were lauded as much for canny selection as for literary skill.</p> <p>In the <a href="https://viraltexts.org">Viral Texts Project</a>, we take our website’s own head piece from an illustration that appeared <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030616430&amp;seq=65">in <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> in January of 1874</a>, which depicts the editor of the fictional <em>Podonk Weekly Bugle</em> considering whether to accept two chickens as payment for a year’s subscription when, as the accompanying article notes, “payment of a little hard cash” would be more useful. While it is condescending to its subject—as the title <em>Podonk Weekly Bugle</em> immediately suggests—the article nonetheless praises the small, rural papers that made up the majority of the US newspaper network and were “the only means by which many of [their] readers receive intelligence of what is going on in the great world outside.” In the illustration, we see again the scissors and paste pot, on the editor’s desk, sitting atop clippings from other newspapers that he is considering for inclusion in the <em>Bugle</em>. In his garbage can are clippings that did not make the cut—pun intended—while behind the subscriber we see a compositor using a pasted-up clipping to set type to reprint a chosen selection.</p> <p><a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026601/1868-12-02/ed-1/seq-1/"><img style="float: right; padding: 30px; width: 40%" src="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/Screenshot%202024-05-12%20at%2012.49.41.png?raw=true"/></a></p> <p>In <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026601/1868-12-02/ed-1/seq-1/">a popular selection</a> that made the rounds in the 1860s, often called out as from “an exchange,” an “editor of a country newspaper” rebuffs charges of poverty by declaring, among other things, “We have a good office, a paste-pot.” <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025007/1847-08-18/ed-1/seq-4">Another selection</a> provided a recipe for making paste, and noted “Next to scissors, paste is an invaluable editorial assistant” before praising the creator of this new recipe as “a Godfrey, a Franklin, a Fulton, a Davy, or a Morse.” While certainly some contemporaries criticized “scissors and paste” journalism, the frequency with which practitioners highlighted—even richly illustrated—the scissors and the paste pot signal they valued selection and aggregation as distinct editorial and literary practices. Reprinting was certainly widespread. Using our reprinting data from the <em>Viral Texts</em> project, <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/read/editing-a-paper/section/fc0597a3-5fe1-439c-86f8-0e47e8a55208">we estimate that papers in the period</a> averaged more than 50% reprinted content, with some considerably more or less, and this is a conservative estimate based only on detected reprints.</p> <p>Nineteenth-century editors’ attitude toward text reuse is exemplified in <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84038206/1890-12-27/ed-1/seq-1/">a selection that circulated in the last decade of the century</a>, though often abbreviated from the version I cite here, which insists that “an editor’s selections from his contemporaries” are “quite often the best test of his editorial ability, and that the function of his scissors are not merely to fill up vacant spaces, but to reproduce the brightest and best thoughts…from all sources at the editor’s command.” While noting that sloppy or lazy selection will produce “a stupid issue,” this piece claims that just as often “the editor opens his exchanges, and finds a feast for eyes, heart and soul…that his space is inadequate to contain.” This piece ends by insisting “a newspaper’s real value is not the amount of original matter it contains, but the average quality of all the matter appearing in its columns whether original or selected.” Looking at reprints of this piece, we see another key element of newspaper exchanges; texts were not only copied verbatim, but were modified as they circulated. Sometimes texts were shortened, and only particular sections circulated widely. Details were changed to fit particular a paper’s geographic location, audience, political stance, or special interests. Material might be added to contextualize or editorialize.</p> <h3 id="iii-large-language-models">III. Large Language Models</h3> <p>We can see in the nineteenth-century newspaper exchanges a massive system for recycling and remediating culture. I do not wish to slip into hyperbole or anachronism, and will not claim historical newspapers as a precise analogue for twenty-first century AI or large language models. But it is striking how often metaphors drawn from earlier media appear in our attempts to understand and explain these new technologies. The most famous critique of LLMs, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Bender <em>et al</em>’s “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots,”</a> describes an LLM as “a system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic forms it has observed in its vast training data.”<sup id="fnref:Bender" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Bender" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">Ted Chiang turns</a> to more recent copying technologies, comparing ChatGPT to a model of Xerox photocopiers that stored data in a compressed JPEG format, which subtly blurred images—a effect magnified when copies were made of copies.<sup id="fnref:Chiang" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Chiang" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> A <a href="https://twitter.com/CosmoWenman/status/1568032424835297280">widely-shared and cited 2022 tweet</a> from Cosmo Wenman—who describes himself as an artist and “open access activist”—looks even further back to characterize AI image synthesis as:</p> <blockquote> <p>like movable type for visual concepts. It is going to facilitate a radical expansion and diffusion of the power to communicate with visual rhetoric unlike anything the world has ever seen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Whether we are talking about ChatGPT for written language or something like Stable Diffusion for images, such arguments emphasize how these systems allow users to abstract an overall idea into discrete, atomized concepts that can be iteratively combined, like sorts from a typecase. To generate this image, for instance, we might imagine that I drew from my conceptual typecase the idea of “a woodcut,” “a robot,” “setting movable type,” and “in a historical print shop” to produce this hybrid image. The metaphor claims these systems make concepts, rather than the alphabet, almost infinitely recombinable.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/0_A%20humanoid%20robot%20setting%20type%20in%20a%20print%20shop%2C%20in%20_esrgan-v1-x2plus-2.png"><img style="align: center; padding: 30px; width:100%" src="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/0_A%20humanoid%20robot%20setting%20type%20in%20a%20print%20shop,%20in%20_esrgan-v1-x2plus-2.png?raw=true"/></a></p> <p>Importantly, large language models are do not work like simpler autocomplete algorithms, which suggest the next word in a string based on the probability of one word following another. LLMs include also “attention,” which means these models are trained to understand words’ place within much longer strings of text—what literary scholars might call context—so they can, <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/">as Stephen Wolfram explains</a>, do things like “captur[e] the way, say, verbs can refer to nouns that appear many words before them in a sentence.”<sup id="fnref:Wolfram" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Wolfram" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Second, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155">as Ouyang <em>et al</em> show</a>, models like ChatGPT have been trained on additional, human-derived metadata, such as that generated by labelers who evaluated the helpfulness (or unhelpfulness) of responses to their prompts.<sup id="fnref:Ouyang" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Ouyang" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> While in theory LLMs remix their source data more fully than newspaper editors cutting and pasting texts wholesale, we have seen in discussions of plagiarism that these systems’ “probabilistic information about how [words] combine” often lead them to combine words in precisely the way they were combined in a text from their training data. This effect is so strong that <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00118">a team of researchers</a> was able to query which in-copyright works are present in GPT4’s training data by asking ChatGPT to complete sentences from those works with character names the model could only know if that work was present in the training data.<sup id="fnref:Chang" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Chang" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p> <p>This aspect of large language models points to a salient comparison with nineteenth-century newspaper reprinting, which is the fuzzy application of copyright and intellectual property to the medium. The content in US newspapers was not explicitly protected by copyright until 1909, though some publishers began affixing copyright notices to particular articles (or even whole issues) in the late nineteenth century. <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29452">As Will Slauter demonstrates</a>, however, most editors “understood that newspapers were mutually dependent” and did not seek to enforce charges of plagiarism against each other.<sup id="fnref:Slauter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Slauter" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> While there was a general expectation (and sometimes social pressure) to cite source papers when selecting, those citations were uneven at best, and even citations were reprinted in ways that could be unreliable, such that a mistaken citation could get picked up by the exchange system and repeated. Drawing on our reprinting data from <em>Viral Texts</em>, we can say with confidence that 1. explicit citation was not as common as injunctions from editors might lead us to believe, 2. lack of citation is never a guarantee of originality, and 3. even explicit citation is often incorrect. Here we might think of the hallucinated citations often created by ChatGPT, which similarly “work” when verification will prove too time consuming.</p> <p>The fuzziness of newspaper copyright, however, led to problems when material from media like books, which were protected by copyright, found their way into newspapers, where the dynamics of the exchange system would quickly lead to their wide distribution. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt4cghh7">As Meredith McGill has shown</a>, authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Charles Dickens complained loudly about being widely read and wildly popular in the newspapers without benefiting financially, while other authors like Fanny Fern sought to take advantage of reprinting to build a reputation they could capitalize on when selling books.<sup id="fnref:McGill" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:McGill" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> The distributed nature of newspaper exchanges made it difficult to assert even clear-cut cases of plagiarism from books, so while many texts that began in books were reprinted in newspapers, few legal actions were taken. In 2024, <a href="https://authorsguild.org/advocacy/artificial-intelligence/">the list of lawsuits against generative AI</a> seems to grow daily, with organizations such as the Authors Guild and the <em>New York Times</em> arguing their protected works have been used without permission as training data and can be reflected back in the model’s generative output. AI companies and proponents argue that their technology is an example of transformative use,” drawing on (among other things) <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-4829/13-4829-2015-10-16.html">a landmark 2015 finding in favor of Google Books</a>, against the Authors Guild, which found “Google’s making of a digital copy to provide a search function is a transformative use, which augments public knowledge by making available information <em>about</em> Plaintiffs’ books without providing the public with a substantial substitute for matter protected by the Plaintiffs’ copyright interests in the original works or derivatives of them.”<sup id="fnref:Authors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Authors" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p> <p>By characterizing Google Books—and, as AI defenders are now arguing, services like ChatGPT—as information architecture that “augments public knowledge,” these companies echo the arguments offered for newspaper exchange in <a href="https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=861">the Post Office Act of 1792</a>, which codified and underwrote the exchange system by allowing “every printer of newspapers” to “send one paper to each and every other printer of newspapers within the United States, free of postage;” made mailing newspapers cheap for other purposes; and made it illegal for postal employees to interfer with newspaper mailing. These laws were advocated by, among others, the US’ first Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin, specifically to ensure that information—or, more accurately to the period—“intelligence”—would circulate widely.</p> <p>The most important contrast between the nineteenth-century newspaper exchange system and twenty-first century tech systems is that their commercial contexts are inverted. The Post Office Act of 1792 ensured that the postal system would <em>not</em> be a commercially-driven enterprise. The exchange system allowed small, local publications to work collectively to gather and distribute information, and prevented government interference in that cooperative arrangement. In the late nineteenth century the growth of wire services and corporate consolidation of newspaper publication led to louder calls—and eventually successful lobbying—for explicit protection of newspaper content as intellectual property. In other words, the exchange system ended in large part because newspapers became primarily corporate rather than civic media, and journalism became both a profession and a category of authorship to be protected as it became a salable commodity.</p> <p>By contrast, AI systems largely began as corporate products. AI scholar and game designer <a href="https://cohost.org/mtrc/post/5864615-you-don-t-hate-ai-y">Mike Cook suggests</a> that much of our collective anxiety about AI is not rooted in the technology itself but instead rooted in open access materials or protected intellectual property being repackaged for corporate profit, or being used to harm workers. Writing about responses to “an AI tool that could automatically colour in anime line art,” Cook argues, “what I saw…wasn’t that they didn’t like the technology itself, but rather that they were worried it would be used to put people out of work, because capitalism inevitably will see this as a route to increased profit” and become “a weapon against us.”<sup id="fnref:Cook" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Cook" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> Thinking back to the metaphor of generative AI as “movable type for concepts,” recalls <a href="https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000264/000264.html">Elyse Graham’s writing on “The Printing Press as Metaphor”</a>, which highlights the commercial imperatives underlying such rhetoric:</p> <blockquote> <p>Another context that illuminates the marketplace value of the printing press metaphor is that of Silicon Valley. The distinctive incentive structures of Silicon Valley—start-up culture, venture capital financing, payment in stock options, IPOs—are geared toward the rhetoric of revolutionary change. For a company seeking investors to claim that the near future will be radically changed from the present, and that this change will be predicated on the autonomous force of changing technologies, implies that the future is manageable and claims ownership of that terrain. It recommends investors to the company and consumers to its products. To claim that technological change is gradual, iterative, unpredictable, and never fully complete, and that the future of technology will depend at least as much on social and cultural factors as on machinery viewed in isolation, would obviously be a weaker sell.<sup id="fnref:Graham" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Graham" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>In reality, generative AI is more like movable type where the precise location of different characters in the drawer is obscured, or setting type in a language you do not speak fluently. The resulting composition may turn out as you expect, but there may also have been words lost in translation—misheard, misspelled, or just missed. Of course, you may simply be reproducing—without knowledge or attribution—someone else’s work, or unknowingly perpetuating misinformation. While nineteenth-century editors sometimes commented on the veracity of the stories they selected and reprinted, they more often simply marked them as “going the rounds,” a signal of circulation rather than veracity, which was difficult to assure in an environment where texts could be and were adapted to every political, geographical, social, or rhetorical end. As we argue in <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/read/viral-textuality/section/68f0f4ac-3c04-4324-ba67-cb4278081322">the introduction to our book, which is titled <em>Going the Rounds</em></a>, that phrase “sometimes licensed editors to circulate material of dubious quality while washing their hands of responsibility for its veracity.” We might compare this to the term “hallucinations” used for AI systems in 2024. While the discussion of “hallucinations” does acknowledge some limitations for generative AI, the phrase also displaces responsibility by positing a temporarily discombobulated subjectivity rather than a flawed technical pipeline.</p> <h3 id="iv-mixed-media-metaphors">IV.

It also bears an uncanny resemblance to “The New Steam Compositor” that appeared in Andrew W. Tuer’s 1884 book of printing jokes, <em>Quads for Authors, Editors, and Devils</em>, an illustration intended to satirize the rhetoric of technological progress in the late nineteenth-century, and the ways that progress would in reality be felt by laborers.</p> <p>While much of our attention in <em>Viral Texts</em> centers editors and writers, the compositor—the person would reset chosen selections in type for each local newspaper—helps us draw a more nuanced line between the nineteenth-century print shop and the twenty-first century language model. In <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95063180/1858-07-01/ed-1/seq-2/">a selection from the <em>Freeman’s Champion</em></a> (Prairie City, Kansas) the compositor is described as an automaton who “must remember the impressions his eye caught” of the copy before him and “proceed mechanically to pick up the individual letters of which every word is composed” without distraction, a daily reality which takes a physical toll and “brings the compositor to a premature old age.” An article on “Fast Type Setting” in <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87075001/1870-06-03/ed-1/seq-1/">the <em>Conservative</em> newspaper</a> of M’connelsville, Ohio recommends a series of physical habits that will help a compositor “not make any false motions” and perform their duty with robotic precision and speed. An earlier piece in the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062070/1836-12-09/ed-1/seq-1/"><em>Arkansas Advocate</em></a> (Little Rock, Arkansas Territory) outlines the “Miseries of a Compositor,” noting that “We hear a good deal of the miseries of editors” but far less “of their humble coadjutors, the compositors.” This piece insists, “The employment of a compositor is of a two-fold nature, mechanical and mental” and notes that the compositor “has a certain number of squares expected from him as a day’s work…whether his copy be clear or obscure, legible or illegible, punctuated or not.”</p> <p>In contrast to many of the above examples, an obituary in <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89060060/1872-11-15/ed-1/seq-1/">the <em>Port Tobacco Times</em></a> for Charles W. Alcott, described as “a model compositor,” praises the fact “that when a piece of manuscript of poor chirography was handed him, he had the intelligence to discover its defects, and supply any omissions which the writer may have made,” going on to bemoan that most “compositors pursue their vocation as mere automatons—picking up type mechanically as it were—and never pausing to exercise the reasoning faculties.” In a widely reprinted joke, which appeared, among many other places, in the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86079077/1871-09-30/ed-1/seq-1/"><em>Opelousas Journal</em></a>, editors are lampooned for thinking typesetting required no skill and could be done without compositors, a mistake revealed in the horrendous typesetting in the selection. Here, then, the compositor’s humanity and intelligence are praised, though as other pieces from the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84038126/1876-09-01/ed-1/seq-1/"><em>Benton Record</em></a>(Benton, Montana Territory) and <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86076999/1881-06-05/ed-1/seq-3/"><em>Morning Appeal</em></a> (Carson City, NV) show, for many in the print industry the very phrase “intelligent compositor” was a joke and scapegoat. The “intelligent compositor,” in these tellings, is someone who exercises too much editorial discretion and corrects copy beyond what the author would wish or the text would warrant, to the point of spoiling a text’s meaning or a joke’s punchline by “fixing” regional dialect or an orthographic pun. In this reprinted joke from the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026844/1881-12-01/ed-1/seq-3/"><em>Wheeling Daily Intelligencer</em></a>, for instance, a woman fainted “dead away” reading “Babies are fashionable this season.” The mistake is “all the fault of the intelligence compositor,” who was supposed to set, “Rubies are fashionable this season.”</p> <p>In both twenty-first century rhetoric about artificial intelligence and nineteenth-century jokes about printers or compositors, we can trace anxiety about—even contrasting desires for—the line between “the mechanical and the mental.” Nineteenth-century editors wanted compositors who worked tirelessly and automatically, but also compositors who exercised discretion, even ingenuity. If we want to draw a direct comparison between large language models and the print shop, the LLM is perhaps more a species of compositor than an editor, as its textual resetting is more granular, individual words and phrases rather than—usually, at least—whole snippets. Likewise if we cast a system like ChatGPT as a “mechanical” tool, we deflect or flatten questions about biases in its training data, intellectual property theft, or the ethics of its use in academic or professional writing. Ultimately, AI systems remix existing cultural artifacts, rather than producing new ideas. This is a common critique but also a means of locating these technologies within the continuum book historians and bibliographers study, and in fact places them in dialogue with a range of historical media that are also based in overlay, pastiche, and remix, such as commonplace books, scrapbooks, palimpsests, or of course newspaper reprinting. None of these practices are identical to the species of text reuse produced by an LLM, but the practices share family resemblances.</p> <h3 id="v-llm-analyses">V. LLM Analyses</h3> <p>In this final section, I want to suggest a few ways the family resemblances between reprinted nineteenth-century newspaper texts and large language models might facilitate scholarly analysis, both <em>of</em> and <em>with</em> LLMs. Much has been written about the lackluster output of services like ChatGPT for student (and other) writing. As models designed to produce text probabilistically, based on existing text in their training data, language models tend to generate average or mundane prose, at least thus far. I want to suggest, however, that for historians, literary scholars, and other humanities researchers, this quality of LLMs can be a boon to tasks also based on normative patterns across large-scale historical newspaper collections, such as genre classification, textual segmentation, or topic identification. As <a href="https://tedunderwood.com/2021/10/21/latent-spaces-of-culture/">Ted Underwood argues</a>, “Historians are already in the habit of finding meaning in genres, nursery rhymes, folktale motifs, ruins, political trends, and other patterns that never had a single author with a clear purpose.” When considered not as objective representations of all language, but instead as highly contextual “models of culture,” LLMs become not unknowable oracles but instead bound, describable, and comparable cultural artifacts that we can both study and use.</p> <p>At the core of many of the debates around AI models of culture—whether text, image, audio, or video—is anxiety about corporate control, proprietary software, and “black-box” systems. Such machine learning models are trained on massive amounts of data, but OpenAI and other companies typically do not disclose the exact composition of their models’ training data, making it difficult for users to ascertain the reliability, representativeness, or limitations of the models, or their relevance to different domains. That the companies building these models wish to obscure their provenance and functions, however, does not mean those things are unavailable for study and analysis. In <a href="https://ryancordell.org/research/aibibliography/">a talk last year</a>, I discussed a series of approaches based on bibliography and data archaeology for reverse engineering AI systems.</p> <p>Throughout this talk I have suggested that historical newspaper reprinting we study in <em>Viral Texts</em> might help illuminate LLMs, and in that earlier talk I discuss how the reprint detection methods we use for tracing historical reprinting offer an approach to reverse engineering an LLM like GPT. I will not repeat that information here, but it suggests that since LLM-generated prose is, as Bender <em>et al</em> argue, “stitched together” from existing prose, methods used to study historical text reuse can help use understand the seams in that stitching.</p> <p>In newer experiments, I draw on the LLM not to generate new text, but instead to compare and annotate, two of the “basic functions common to scholarly activity across disciplines” that <a href="https://people.brandeis.edu/~unsworth/Kings.5-00/primitives.html">John Unsworth named</a> “scholarly primitives.” These are both tasks of pattern recognition that might be productively automated. In the case of <em>Viral Texts</em> our initial reprint-detection methods are largely content-agnostic, seeking only to identify passages of text that are duplicated across pages. This generates many millions of prospective reprints, which we then sift through in various ways in search of meaningful texts and patterns which we can analyze with both computational and humanistic methods. In experiments with project RAs <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/read/untitled-bd3eb0af-fdad-4dd6-9c94-3fd15d522ab6/section/06899e82-8f06-43d2-9fc9-ea04dffef886">Jonathan D. Fitzgerald</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/rhad493">Avery Blankenship</a>, I have experimented with methods for computational genre analysis to identify texts useful for particular studies of poetry, or fiction, or news, and so on. The scale of our data makes a computational approach to genre necessary.</p> <p>These experiments were largely supervised genre classification, where we train a model for a genre of interest by hand-tagging a corpus of texts from that genre. The model learns from the training data the linguistic or structural features of the genre, and when applied to an unknown text will assign a probability that the unknown text belongs to the trained genre. This is a well-established method for genre detection, but requires significant time and labor creating the training set and is difficult to adjust on the fly, as (for example) new genres come to light. While GPT-4 was not trained primarily on nineteenth-century newspaper writing, it was, I would argue, trained on similar, modern genres. And like the output of an LLM, the point of genre is to group similar texts together. Though scholars disagree about the precise boundaries, every genre label is an argument about patterns, similarities, and commonalities. In other words, the normative features of an LLM are precisely why they might work well for genre analysis at scale, at least so long as the genre categories are relatively broad.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/VTGenre-GPT.R">I wrote a script that prompts GPT4</a> to assign a genre to each text provided from a pre-determined list of possible genres.<sup id="fnref:script" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:script" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> I use a pre-determined list to prevent it responding in a verbose way that would be difficult to work with computationally, and also to prevent too long a list of niche or subgenres, though it could be interesting to see what genres it would assign without such a constraint. It should be said that even with these constraints, the API occasionally returned a genre not in my list, or a response with additional prose (e.g. “the genre of the provided text would”) that was not requested.</p> <p>For the most part, however, in this experiment <a href="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/vt-genres-largeClusters.csv">GPT4’s labels tend to align with those a human researcher would likely make</a>. Hand-checking a list of 300 random clusters assigned genres by GPT4, I only strongly disagreed with 3 of its assignments, and I might have quibbled with another 6 or so, as texts that crossed genres, but which I would not say were wrong. As with standard genre classification experiments where you might ask more than one expert to label each text, to find points of agreement or divergence, I could imagine comparing human and LLM-derived labels, or even using multiple models and using labels where they agree. Expanding the inquiry a bit, I used GPT4 to label genre for the 1000 largest clusters in our Viral Texts data. Though we work to filter out advertisements, they inevitably leak through, so I am not surprised it was the biggest category. We might also not be surprised to see “political” in the second spot. From here, however, we see some of the unique features of nineteenth-century newspapers, as “advice,” “poem,” “religious,” “humor,” and “literary” occupy the five next positions ahead, even, of “news.”</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/1000%20top%20clusters.png"><img style="align: center; padding: 30px; width:100%" src="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/1000%20top%20clusters.png?raw=true"/></a></p> <p>I do think these experiments benefit from the generic similarities between newspapers and the web, and similar experiments on texts more divergent from LLMs’ training data would likely see less reliable results. Currently scholars are building large language models trained on period or genre-specific data, which will be better suited to these kinds of tasks. But even without fine-tuning, these results are promising. Importantly, my goal with these experiments is not to prove a theory or build a model of genre. These labels will not contribute to claims about where the line between humor and anecdote actually can or should be drawn. In the nineteenth-century paper, anecdotes are often humorous, so this line is not easily determined. Instead, my aims are practical. We have an enormous well of data about nineteenth-century newspaper reprinting, out of which we often want to identify and more closely explore particular subsets. An initial pass labeling by genre would be an enormous boon to such exploration, allowing us—for instance—to more easily filter to a subset of clusters likely to be poems, fiction, jokes, and so on. These results will prompt me to experiment more with LLMs as an exploratory tool for large historical datasets. In particular, I hope to run similar experiments with models finetuned on historical newspaper data to see if they are both more reliable and more amendable to scholarly nuance. Comparison among models will be essential to this work moving forward, ideally among both corporate models and alternatives managed by non-profit or academic organizations.</p> <p>Which brings me to another, similar experiment, which takes advantage of LLMs’ usefulness summarizing provided texts, as <a href="https://tedunderwood.com/tag/llms/">Underwood has shown</a>. The <em>Viral Texts</em> project is currently collaborating with Washington University’s <a href="https://www.racialviolencearchive.com/">Racial Violence Archive</a> on <a href="https://viraltexts.org/2023/01/24/vrt/">“The Virality of Racial Terror in US Newspapers, 1863-1921</a>, which seeks “to trace the the circulation of reports about anti-Black violence in US newspapers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.” One of our initial goals is to develop methods to automatically identify whether stories in our historical newspaper data are likely to be about an incident of racial violence. In some ways this is a similar problem to genre detection, but is complicated by the fact that many historical newspaper archives, such as Chronicling America, do not divide their data by article, but instead by page, which means a report about an incident of racial violence may be nested within a much larger text that includes many other topics and genres. We are approaching this problem from several methodological angles—most of which I cannot describe today—but in one very preliminary but intriguing experiment, I used GPT4 to summarize newspaper pages, identifying any sections of text that seemed to report an incident of racial violence. In this case, I used pages from the <em>New National Era</em>, a newspaper published in Washington D.C. by J. Sella Martin and Frederick Douglass in the 1870s, advocating for reconstruction, reporting on the US Black community and its efforts toward equality, documenting continued prejudice and violence against the Black community, and sharing general news.</p> <p>GPT4 does <a href="https://github.com/rccordell/rccordell.github.io/blob/master/img/pastepot/VRT-answers.csv">a reasonably good job</a> identifying passages within larger text that may address incidents of racial violence. It identifies two such texts in the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026753/1873-04-24/ed-1/seq-2/">24 April 1873</a> issue, for instance. It first highlights the article “Louisiana,” which describes “The brutal and cowardly massacre in Grant Parish of colored men by white men in obedience to the teachings of such negro-hating journals as the New York <em>Tribune</em>.” Elsewhere on that same page, the article “Shall the Doctrine be Universally Applied?” quotes the Boston <em>Globe</em>’s argument for retributive violence against Native Americans and asks whether “the whole rebel population” of the South will be similarly punished for their unrelenting violence against Black Americans, which the article lists only in part. In some ways GPT4 is perhaps too broad in its interpretation of this task, selecting in other instances text a historian might categorize as discrimination, but not violence. Likely this particular task would benefit greatly from fine-tuning or a custom language model, as the subtleties of nineteenth-century newspaper language can make this information retrieval task more challenging for a model trained on the twenty-first century internet. However, if the goal for this work is to process thousands or even millions of newspaper pages and identify smaller, discrete articles worthy of closer scholarly attention by a human expert, these results are, to my mind promising.</p> <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3> <p>It is not lost on me that in this final experiment I am asking GPT-4 to act as a kind of exchanges editor: to comb through a digital pile of newspaper pages, identify and cut out texts of interest to my research, and paste them into a dataframe for further analysis. In comparing historical practices of unoriginal writing and contemporary AI, I do not seek to collapse historical distinctions or wave away concerns about the material and ethical implications of AI. Instead, I seek to cut through some of the marketing hype and position AI technologies as material-cultural phenomena which we can apprehend and critique—and teach our students to apprehend and critique—by adapting our existing qualitative and quantitative toolkits.</p> <p>I would argue that our path forward with large-language models and other AI models will rest in pedagogy. As communities of scholars and practioners assemble more robust understandings of these tools, their training data, and the workings of their generative algorithms, we can help students dissect those same workings, evaluate the ways in which such tools might (or might not) assist their work, and advocate for needed changes and regulation. Looking toward longer histories of unoriginal writing can help contextualize debates that seem novel and thus unknowable. Generative AI is not quite movable type for concepts, but there is a link between these systems and the printing house we can use to cut through the hype.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:Bull" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Bull, Sarah. 2023. “Content Generation in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” <em>Book History</em>, pg. 325 <a href="#fnref:Bull" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:Bender" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Bender, Emily M., Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell. 2021. “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? &amp;#X1f99c;” In <em>Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency</em>, 610–23.

Mellon Society of Fellows in Critical Bibliography <a href="https://rarebookschool.org/all-programs/events/preserving-and-analyzing-digital-texts/">forum on “Preserving and Analyzing Digital Texts.”</a></em></p> <p>In 2022 new AI image, text, video, and music models seem to appear every week, spurring waves of attention in social media and forcing constant reconsiderations of the horizons of such technology, as well as their implications to research and teaching. Most dramatic was the release of ChatGPT,<sup id="fnref:ChatGPT" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ChatGPT" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> a large language model developed by OpenAI and released to much fanfare and critique in late 2022. Since that release this model has generated significant enthusiasm and anxiety among different stakeholders, from companies eager to integrate it into applications from writing assistance to search, to professors worried students will outsource writing their college papers to the technology.<sup id="fnref:ChatGPTDebate" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ChatGPTDebate" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The debate about ChatGPT has in many ways become a proxy for larger debates about algorithmic accountability, fairness, and reliability. In the mere months since ChatGPT was released, a yet newer generation large language model, which OpenAI promises will be “more creative and collaborative than ever before,” has been released as GPT-4.<sup id="fnref:GPT4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:GPT4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The pace of these AI announcements has certainly contributed to the sense that everyone, but perhaps especially those working in educational sectors, are scrambling to keep up.</p> <p>At the core of many of the debates around AI models of culture—whether text, image, audio, or video—is anxiety about corporate control, proprietary software, and “black-box” systems. These models are machine learning systems, trained on massive amounts of data, but OpenAI and other companies typically do not disclose the exact composition of their models’ training data, making it difficult for users to ascertain the reliability, representativeness, or limitations of the models, or their relevance to different domains. That the companies building these models wish to obscure their provenance and functions, however, does not mean those things are unavailable for study and analysis.</p> <p>This paper argues first that responding to this moment mandates developing toolkits for structural analyses of AI systems, and second that such methods should bring together two related traditions: the sociological school of bibliography and book history, which forefronts the linked technological, social, economic, and artistic contexts through which books and related media come into being, and the growing set of methods gathered under the mantle of “data archaeology,” which seek to outline similarly linked contexts through which datasets are created, distributed, and accessed. Such a bibliography for AI systems triangulates between materiality, infrastructure, and labor to describe the systems of digitization, archiving, extraction, and representation that lead from digitized and born-digital sources to the strings of text output by LLMs in response to user prompts. Just as D.F. McKenzie argued bibliographers should “describe not only the technical but the social processes of [texts’] transmission,” AI systems require a bibliography that studies the diffuse and often obscured sociology of textual data.<sup id="fnref:McKenzie" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:McKenzie" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> In prior work I have argued for the value of <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/angl/138/3/article-p519.xml">“speculative bibliographies”</a> for historical research, by which I primarily described enumerative bibliographies “in which textual associations are constituted propositionally, iteratively, and (sometimes) temporarily, as the result of probabilistic computational models.”<sup id="fnref:speculative" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:speculative" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Here, however, I advocate for speculative analytical or descriptive bibliographies that hypothesize about the material bases of closed AI systems based on extant clues about their composition and through reverse engineering of their outputs.</p> <p>I approach this project first from the perspective of bibliography in part because of my own training, but also because the field offers a useful orientation and toolkit for the humanistic investigation of technical systems. Bibliographic methods were first developed to make predictions about a text’s material construction, editing, and significance from clues rooted historically in systems of production—the infrastructures of print culture. Signatures, chain lines, watermarks, and other physical clues were not placed in books deliberately by papermakers, printers, or binders for scholars, but are artifacts of production—papermaking, printing, binding—that scholars discovered could be reverse engineered in order to analyze the details of that production. In the late 20th century—I use this formulation even as I turn to dust—bibliographers such as Thomas Tanselle began thinking about how bibliographic frameworks could adapt to describe the increasingly dominant modes of electronic textual production, such as word processing, that would produce bookish objects going forward. Similarly to books in the printing press era or documents in the word processing era, complex computational systems in 2023 are not constructed with an eye toward transparency or material analysis, but leave clues that can be collated and theorized.</p> <p>In addition to these historical parallels, I would also argue that LLMs are ripe for bibliographical analysis because they are, specifically and substantively, deeply bookish. We know they were trained, at least in part, on book data—as well as other forms familiar to bibliographers, such as academic journals, newspapers, and magazines. We might describe AI systems as “pastiche engines,” remixing existing cultural artifacts, rather than producing new ideas. This is both a critique and a means of locating these technologies within the continuum book historians and bibliographers study, and in fact places them in dialogue with a range of historical media that are also based in overlay, pastiche, and remix—media such as commonplace books, scrapbooks, palimpsests, or newspapers. The reprinting we study in the <a href="https://viraltexts.org/"><em>Viral Texts</em> project</a> is not identical to the species of text reuse produced by an LLM, but the practices share a family resemblance. As Ted Underwood has written, “the fuzzy, context-specific models produced by machine learning have a lot in common with the family resemblances historians glimpse in culture.”<sup id="fnref:underwood" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:underwood" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Because AI models are context-specific, I would argue, methods for contextualization—both quantitative and qualitative—will prove necessary for understanding them. LLMs and other AI models are not <em>only</em> bibliographic, but they do refract a sociology of texts that bibliographers can help assemble.</p> <p>To date, much bibliographic study of digital textuality has focused on the materiality of computation—forensic studies of the hard drive’s textual inscriptions, for example, or vertical analysis of the layered software and hardware of a single ebook. Matthew Kirschenbaum’s landmark 2008 book <em>Mechanisms</em> traced both the “forensic materiality” of digital texts—e.g. the inscription of data onto the substrates of storage media—and formal materiality, which focuses on the representation of data in different computational systems—such as the ways specific file formats enable and constrain particular uses of data.<sup id="fnref:Kirschenbaum" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Kirschenbaum" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> It is difficult to know how we might trace the forensic materiality of an LLM’s output. While the data for LLMs exists somewhere, that existence is far more diffuse, abstract, and distributed than that of a discrete digital document or bound set of files on a particular computer, ebook reader, or server. Even if we had access to the corporate systems that house these models, is the textual data undergirding an LLM inscribed in any single place to which we could point, in the way that bibliographers point to a particular witness of a particular state of a particular edition of a particular book? Most likely not, as the models dynamically construct new texts each time a user prompts them, and these texts—while certainly not immaterial—are more dynamic and ephemeral than the mutable files on our hard drives.</p> <p>To investigate the forensic materiality of LLMs, then, we should perhaps focus not on specific generated texts, but instead on the infrastructures undergirding AI systems. The field of book history was in many ways founded on Robert Darnton’s argument that the study of books should investigate the “communications circuit that runs from the author to the publisher…the printer, the shipper, the bookseller, and the reader,” an idea (and diagram) that has been much debated and amended since, but which remains central to the field’s work.<sup id="fnref:Darnton" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Darnton" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> To understand similar facets of AI systems, we could take as exemplars pieces like Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler’s “Anatomy of an AI System,” in which they seek to outline every element required for an Amazon Alexa device to answer a question, from the data model to the minerals mined to create the hardware.<sup id="fnref:AnatomyAI" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:AnatomyAI" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> As <a href="https://liu.english.ucsb.edu/toward-critical-infrastructure-studies-u-connecticut/">Alan Liu has argued</a>, cultural studies and critical infrastructure studies collapse into each other. In the twenty-first-century, this communications circuit has fused with the supply chain, and an analysis of contemporary textual systems like LLMs requires a more capacious account still.</p> <p>If we prompt ChatGPT itself to describe its underlying hardware, its returns a cryptically generic answer:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to a 2020 blog post by OpenAI, ChatGPT-3 (which is a larger version of the model that powers ChatGPT) runs on clusters of thousands of individual CPUs and GPUs, which are distributed across multiple data centers. The specific hardware configurations used in these clusters can vary depending on the specific task being performed by the model and the availability of different hardware components at any given time. OpenAI has also stated that its hardware infrastructure uses a combination of custom-built hardware and off-the-shelf components from vendors such as Nvidia and Intel. This allows the organization to optimize its systems for the specific needs of its AI models while also taking advantage of the latest advances in commercial hardware technology.</p> </blockquote> <p>From here the reply notes “the specific hardware used to power ChatGPT and other OpenAI models is a closely guarded secret, as the organization sees its hardware infrastructure as a key competitive advantage in the field of AI research.” While we may not be able to learn from ChatGPT or OpenAI’s publications the precise make and model of the hardware on which ChatGPT runs, as a category such hardware also is not a profound mystery. We can make reasonable assumptions about the kinds of machines required to host and process data at this scale, or serve the model through a web application to users. A basic search for “GPT-3 hardware” will surface many experts attempting to estimate the precise stack that would be required to run the ChatGPT service, whether in more formal articles, social media threads, or Reddit forums, and publications by the teams behind different models—particularly older models, where there is less need for competitive secrecy—offer more specific details.<sup id="fnref:Brown" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Brown" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p> <p>Similar publications also offer insight into the training data behind LLMs. For instance, a 2022 paper by OpenAI researchers describes the development of InstructGPT, an essential element of the model underlying ChatGPT which improved responsiveness to prompts by hiring human “labelers” to annotate responses from the model.<sup id="fnref:instruct" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:instruct" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> These labels assigned value to responses that labelers found more or less useful, and were used to finetune the model to produce responses more similar to those preferred by human annotators. This small detail is key to understanding ChatGPT not as a fully automated computational system, but an iteratively-developed system with humans in the loop. Were we to diagram the communications circuit underlying ChatGPT, in other words, we would include labelers, as an important human element within the AI system, along with the low-wage workers in Kenya that <a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/">a <em>Time</em> magazine expose</a> found OpenAI using to help filter toxic content. Following McKenzie, our AI bibliography must include the many communities of human labor that contribute to each layer of these technical systems.</p> <p>Several of my examples thus far have pointed to the hybrid communities of field experts, practitioners, and hobbyists working to collectively assemble knowledge about the training data and algorithmic processes of large AI models like GPT, often assembling cumulative insight through channels such as Twitter threads, Reddit fora, or linked Github repositories. I understand these efforts through a set of approaches increasingly advocated by ethicists, such as reverse engineering, data archaeology, and algorithmic auditing. We can distinguish these approaches mostly by their explicit goals, as the methods and results of all three overlap:</p> <ol> <li>Reverse engineering is the broadest term, encompassing a range of projects that seek to understand the processes within a closed, undescribed, or “black box” system by dissecting, when possible, or by collating indirect evidence when direct access is unavailable. Reverse engineering happens outside of computational contexts, including even when companies seek to copy a successful product made by a competitor. In terms of software, however, reverse engineering may involve studying code and data, when available, to ascertain how it works, or when that is not possible comparing inputs and outputs to infer what happens within the system. As James A. Hodges and Ciaran B. Trace show in their recent article “Preserving Algorithmic Systems,” “attempts at achieving accountability for algorithms are hampered by factors ranging from commercial developers’ profit motives to the simple obscuring effects of time” and thus often “algorithmic functionality must be reverse-engineered.”<sup id="fnref:hodges" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hodges" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> Reverse engineering is essentially what analytical bibliographers do for bookish objects when they use physical clues to understand how those objects were designed and created.</li> <li>Data archaeology is a narrower concept describing attempts to thoroughly document a technical system—including its hardware, data composition, and software processes—for future developers or scholars, with an eye toward enabling replication. For example, Benjamin Lee’s recent_DHQ_ article traces the entwined technical and social stack enabling the <a href="https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/newspaper-navigator/"><em>Newspaper Navigator</em> project</a> he developed as the Innovator-in-Residence at the Library of Congress Labs.<sup id="fnref:lee" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lee" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> As Lee writes, formal data archeologies are written by scholars “in support of…call[s] for transparency and responsible stewardship” in computational research and represent an ideal for data-rich scholarship.</li> <li>Algorithmic auditing focuses more specifically on identifying and mitigating harm perpetuated by automated systems, often with the goal of identifying implicit bias within systems. This sometimes happens proactively, when a company or organization takes steps to review the impacts of software to ensure they are not inadvertently marginalizing particular groups or identities. However, there is a growing body of scholarship that works to audit the processes of less forthright organizations, often through reverse engineering. Consider Safiya Noble’s <em>Algorithms of Oppression</em>, which reverse engineered the ways Google’s page rank algorithm reinforced racism through iterative search: comparing results to a range of search terms to understand subtle (and not so subtle) differences in the ways data about different racial groups was sorted and presented to users.<sup id="fnref:noble" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:noble" class="footnote" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></li> </ol> <p>When corporate secrecy or negligence prevent transparency, efforts to reverse engineer algorithmic systems provide valuable evidence for bibliographies of AI systems. Consider <a href="https://gist.github.com/veekaybee/6f8885e9906aa9c5408ebe5c7e870698">Vicki Boykis’ notebook “Everything I understand about chatgpt,”</a> which attempts to collate both official and community documentation and outline a theory of ChatGPT’s training data and architecture. For example, Boykis highlights two components of training data named but not described in OpenAI’s publications, intriguingly titled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Books1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Books2</code>, and points to literature describing the development of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BookCorpus</code>, which community investigators believe likely constitutes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Books1</code>. Boykis links both to formal publications, such as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05241">Jack Bandy and Nicholas Vincent’s “Retrospective Datasheet for BookCorpus”</a>, as well as to work by people such as Shawn Presser, who <a href="https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus/issues/27#issuecomment-716104208">provides access to the 18,000 plain text files</a> that make up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bookcorpus</code>. These assembled resources allow researchers to explore at least some of the data thought to compose ChatGPT’s training corpora.</p> <p>Alongside proprietary AI software, there is also a growing community of open-source models that can serve as proxies for understanding closed models. <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm">Databricks’ Dolly</a>, for instance, sought to reverse-engineer the “instruction-following behavior” of InstructGPT and create a “truly open large language model” that would serve their customers who told the company they “would be best served by owning their models, allowing them to create higher quality models for their domain specific applications without handing their sensitive data over to third parties.” But Databricks also offers ethical reasons for creating this dataset, noting that “the important issues of bias, accountability and AI safety should be addressed by a broad community of diverse stakeholders rather than just a few large companies.” Looking beyond these stated reasons, the creation of such open-access mirrors of closed corporate systems provides a comparative framework for bibliographies of AI systems. We could investigate the prompts and responses recorded in Dolly’s training data in order to reconstruct <em>how</em> the data underlying a platform like ChatGPT is likely structured.</p> <p>One principle for bibliographical investigation of AI will be iteration and collection. Users can probe the boundaries and assumptions of an LLM by simply asking variations on particular questions and observing the model’s responses. This is a form of close reading that seeks not to understand the full system, but to reverse engineer one small facet of the system, with a goal—perhaps—of collecting many such examples to build a wider knowledge base. In <a href="https://s23bl.ryancordell.org/lab/2023/01/26/lab2.html">an assignment in my BookLab graduate seminar</a>, for instance, I encouraged students to compare the outputs of different LLMs to the same prompt in order to hypothesize about how their training data is composed or how their models differ; to make incremental changes to prompts within a model to see how that changes the output; to evaluate the responses of LLMs to domains students knew well, to ascertain the veracity of the model’s data; and to interrogate “limit cases” that push a model beyond its capabilities. One student found ChatGPT incapable of producing bilingual text—at least in the hybrid, fast code switching way she wanted to see—producing instead text that switched languages by paragraph. Other students struggled against the guardrails OpenAI has placed on the application—not, importantly, the model itself—to produce an “insult” or “diss track.” While the GPT language model is perfectly capable of assembling negative language, OpenAI restricts such language in order to prevent the internet from internetting. Such discrete limit testing will not produce a theory of ChatGPT writ large, but the accumulation of such tests can begin filling out a picture of what kinds of texts comprise its training data and the ways the model has been fine tuned to enable certain kinds of outputs and prevent others.</p> <p>This iterative approach is also amenable to computational investigation. At the beginning of this talk I compared the textual remixing of LLMs, which I described as “pastiche engines,” with the historical newspaper reprinting we study in <em>Viral Texts</em>. Given that similarity, the reprint detection methods we use for tracing historical reprinting might offer an apporach to reverse engineering an LLM like GPT. I won’t belabor an explanation of those methods here, but we detail them in the second chapter, <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/read/untitled-883630b9-c054-44e1-91db-d053a7106ecb/section/ea1f849a-bac1-4e9d-85f4-149d0083a6a4">“Textual Criticism as Language Modeling”</a> of our Manifold scholar book, <em>Going the Rounds</em>. In extreme brief, however, we use a fuzzy matching method that identifies sets of duplicated phrases across texts. The texts do not have to match from end to end, but simply contain enough matching phrases to be flagged as “the same” by our algorithm.</p> <p>While LLMs assemble text probabilistically, drawing on a wide range of textual sources, they nevertheless retain signals from their training data. If asked to write about a given topic, the words most likely to follow other words will bear a resemblance to the words that follow other words in training data about that topic. This is one reason that users have observed instances of plagiarism in LLM output. Often the best sequence of words—from the perspective of a language model at least—is precisely the sequence of words in an existing source, particularly for topics without wide coverage in the model’s training data.</p> <p>To observe this on a small scale, I used the GPT-4 API to generate texts on various topics and then compared ngrams—sequences of n words length—between the generated texts and potential open-access sources. When I asked for a biography of nineteenth-century American author Fanny Fern,<sup id="fnref:appendixA" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:appendixA" class="footnote" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> for example, I found that the generated biography shared 57 matching 4-grams with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Fern">Fern’s Wikipedia page</a>, 21 matching 4-grams with the biography on the <a href="https://fannyfern.org/bio"><em>Fanny Fern in the New York Ledger</em></a> DH project website, 24 with Fern’s bio on the <a href="https://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2011/12/fanny-fern.html">History of American Women</a> site, 27 with Fern’s entry at <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fern-fanny-1811-1872">Encyclopedia.com</a>, and none with a <a href="https://faculty.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/fern.html">Georgetown University bio</a> of Fern. Similarly, a prompt asking for a definition and history of the sonnet returned an answer that shared 26 4-grams with entries on the sonnet in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet">Wikipedia</a>, 8 with <a href="https://poets.org/glossary/sonnet">Poets.org</a>, 14 with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/sonnet">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>, 13 with the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/sonnet">Poetry Foundation</a>, and 11 with <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-sonnet-2985266">ThoughtCo</a>.<sup id="fnref:appendixB" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:appendixB" class="footnote" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> These examples are idiosyncratic and partial—proofs of concept—but more sustained and systematic work along these lines is both possible and necessary.</p> <p>In fact, even as I was making these small experiments the <em>Washington Post</em> published a collaborative investigation, with the Allen Institute for AI, which takes a very similar approach to reverse engineer the sources of Google’s C4 dataset.<sup id="fnref:wapo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wapo" class="footnote" rel="footnote">17</a></sup> C4, by the way, stands for <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Documenting-the-English-Colossal-Clean-Crawled-Dodge-Sap/40c3327a6ddb0603b6892344509c7f428ab43d81?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus</a>, which is a fact I just had to share. To determine which open websites were crawled, the researchers “ranked the remaining 10 million websites based on how many ‘tokens’ appeared from each in the data set. Tokens are small bits of text used to process disorganized information—typically a word or phrase.” As in my smaller experiments, they find that Wikipedia is by far the largest source, but as they note others that are less obvious,</p> <blockquote> <p>Some top sites seemed arbitrary,like wowhead.com No. 181, a World of Warcraft player forum; thriveglobal.com No. 175, a product for beating burnout founded by Arianna Huffington; and at least 10 sites that sell dumpsters, including dumpsteroid.com No. 183, that no longer appear accessible.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <em>Post</em> article provides a tool that enables readers to enter a domain to see how many of its tokens it shares with the C4 dataset, which signals how likely it was to have contributed to the corpus.</p> <p>The goal for research along these lines cannot be to prove definitely that a particular model draws on this source or that, though such trends may emerge for more influential sources. Instead, the goal should be to generate probabilities about different potential sources: a speculative analytical or descriptive bibliography that gives us a framework for hypotheses and analysis. To return to my initial claims, it is precisely here that I think bibliographical traditions offer helpful analogs. Though some bibliographers have conceived of their work as empirical, in reality every collation formula is a speculation, though one informed by physical evidence. Just as the industrial processes of print culture left traces that we can use to theorize about physical texts’ production and use, the computational processes of digital culture leave traces we can use to theorize about AI texts.</p> <p>Bringing together bibliographical and computational approaches allows us to perceive AI systems not as unknowable oracles but instead bound, describable, and comparable cultural artifacts. Bibliography’s close attention to understanding and describing the combined material, technological, economic, and social facets of cultural production are precisely what is lacking in much tech discourse in 2023, and are precisely what is needed both to understand the shifts we are undergoing and to advocate for more transparency and responsive systems in the future. In making this argument I am not trying to claim large language models for bibliography, and there are certainly other AI systems that demand distinct expertise. But to the extent that language models are textual media that both draw on and contribute to book culture, they should be the province of bibliographers working in close collaboration with computer scientists, information scientists, technologists, and related experts. AI systems require a bibliography that takes serious the diffuse and often obscured sociology of textual data.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="appendix-a-gpt-4-bio-of-fanny-fern">Appendix A: GPT-4 Bio of Fanny Fern</h2> <p>Fanny Fern: A Biography</p> <p>Early Life</p> <p>Fanny Fern, born Sara Payson Willis on July 9, 1811, in Portland, Maine, was an American novelist, journalist, and feminist activist. She was the fourth of nine children born to Nathaniel and Hannah Willis. Her father was a newspaper publisher and writer, which played a pivotal role in Fern’s interest in writing.</p> <p>In her early life, Fern, like her siblings, was educated at Catherine Beecher’s boarding school in Hartford, Connecticut. Following her education, she returned to Boston, where her family had moved, and began teaching at a local school.</p> <p>Personal Life</p> <p>Fanny Fern married banker Charles Eldredge in 1837, and together they had three children, Mary Stace, Grace, and Ellen Willis Eldredge. Tragically, Charles died of typhoid fever in 1846, leaving Fern to support her family alone.</p> <p>In 1849, Fern remarried to Samuel P. Farrington, a merchant. However, the marriage was unhappy, and the couple divorced in 1851. Following her divorce, Fern decided to seek financial independence through her writing to support herself and her children.</p> <p>Career</p> <p>In 1851, adopting the pen name Fanny Fern, she began writing essays, sketches, and short stories for several newspapers and periodicals, including “The Olive Branch” and “True Flag.” These writings won her a widespread reputation as a courageous, witty, and insightful writer who addressed prevailing social issues, such as women’s rights, marriage, education, and labor rights.</p> <p>Despite facing criticism from her male counterparts and dealing with societal norms of that time, Fern’s perseverance led to significant accomplishments. In 1853, she published her first collection, “Fern Leaves from Fanny’s Portfolio,” which sold over 70,000 copies in its first year. Several more volumes of “Fern Leaves” soon followed.</p> <p>Fanny Fern’s career as a writer took a leap forward in 1855 when she joined the “New York Ledger” as a columnist. She became the highest-paid columnist in the United States at that time, earning $100 per week. Her column, filled with satirical and humorous commentary on contemporary social issues, made her a household name.</p> <p>In 1856, she remarried again, to newspaper editor and biographer James Parton, who encouraged her literary career. Her novel “Ruth Hall,” published that same year, is largely autobiographical, chronicling the struggles of a young widow trying to support her children through writing. It became a bestseller and was praised for its realistic portrayal of women’s experiences.</p> <p>Later Years and Legacy</p> <p>Fern continued to write for the “New York Ledger” and authored more novels, such as “Rose Clark” (1856) and “Folly as It Flies” (1868). While her popularity diminished in the late 19th century, she made a significant contribution to American literature from a female perspective.</p> <p>Fanny Fern died of cancer in New York City on October 10, 1872, at the age of 61. Today, she is celebrated as a pioneer in feminist writing, and her works have inspired generations of women writers to explore themes that were considered taboo in her time.</p> <h2 id="appendix-b-gpt-4-description-of-the-sonnet">Appendix B: GPT-4 Description of the Sonnet</h2> <p>The sonnet is a poetic form that consists of 14 lines, known for exploring themes of love, beauty, and the passage of time, though it has also been used to address a variety of other subjects. It is believed to have originated in Italy in the 13th century and was later popularized by the Italian poet Petrarch in the 14th century. Petrarch’s sonnets, written in Italian, primarily focused on his unrequited love for a woman named Laura. Throughout the years, the sonnet has evolved, and its structure and rhyme schemes have adapted to the preferences of different poets and languages.</p> <p>The sonnet is typically written in iambic pentameter, a metrical pattern consisting of five pairs of stressed and unstressed syllables per line. There are two main types of sonnets: the Italian (or Petrarchan) sonnet and the English (or Shakespearean) sonnet.</p> <p>The Italian sonnet is divided into two parts: the octave, which consists of the first eight lines, and the sestet, which includes the remaining six lines. The octave presents a problem, situation, or question, while the sestet resolves or comments on it. The rhyme scheme for the octave is usually ABBAABBA, while the sestet has various rhyme patterns, such as CDECDE or CDCDCD.</p> <p>The English sonnet, on the other hand, is organized into three quatrains, each comprising four lines, and a final rhymed couplet. The rhyme scheme for this type of sonnet is ABABCDCDEFEFGG. The three quatrains often introduce different aspects or develop a single idea, while the final couplet offers a conclusion, a twist or a resolution to the preceding lines.</p> <p>As the sonnet spread from Italy to England in the 16th century, it was embraced and developed by English Renaissance poets like Sir Thomas Wyatt, Edmund Spenser, and, most notably, William Shakespeare. Shakespeare composed a total of 154 sonnets, which cover themes of love, beauty, and the transient nature of life.</p> <p>The sonnet form continued to thrive in the 17th century through the works of poets like John Donne and Milton, and it has remained a popular form among poets throughout history. Romantic poets like William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley reinvigorated the form in the 19th century; more recently, in the 20th and 21st centuries, it was seen in the works of poets like Elizabeth Barrett Browning, e. e. cummings, and Seamus Heaney.</p> <p>In summary, the sonnet form is a 14-line poem renowned for its exploration of love, beauty, and time. Though it originated in Italy, it has since been embraced and adapted by poets across the world, evolving through various rhyme schemes and structures while maintaining its distinctive essence.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:ChatGPT" role="doc-endnote"> <p>For OpenAI’s introduction to ChatGPT, see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/</a>.

That I was a 4th year PhD student at <em>the University of Virginia</em> who had never been told that either digital humanities or the Scholars’ Lab even existed is a topic for a different talk.</p> <p>When Bethany and I met, I spun out quite a project proposal. If I remember correctly at this distance, I proposed a comprehensive digital edition of every reprinted story that appears in any 19th century newspaper. And Bethany listened patiently, started her remarks encouragingly, and then applied what she called then “the wet blanket of administrative love”—drawing on her extensive expertise to help me understand what was, and wasn’t, feasible for me to create given limited time, funding, and experience.</p> <p>I wish I could say I learned from that interaction how to appropriately scope digital humanities work, but my reach has exceeded my grasp many times in the intervening years. But here I want to focus on a different detail of that interaction, one which I hope I have carried forward into most of what I’ve done since, which is this: though I was a grad student coming to Bethany, naive about a field she’d been leading for awhile, she treated me from the beginning as a fellow scholar whose ideas were worthy to be taken seriously. Her advice aimed to help me understand the infrastructural issues of which I was ignorant, but it was neither condescending nor dismissive. She treated me not like a student, but like a prospective collaborator. I left not defeated, but energized to actually begin the project that would effectively launch my career. Though I was well embarked on a dissertation at that point, it was the project that began in that room that has led to every opportunity since. Though I was brand new to DH, these attitudes were why DH was the first academic community I’d ever joined where I didn’t feel like an imposter.</p> <p>I didn’t realize at the time, but I was fortunate to be introduced to DH through the Scholars Lab at that particular moment, when there was an early but emphatic emphasis on questions of fair collaboration, shared credit, and equitable treatment among teams that included academics in different roles and at different ranks. I can’t promise that I’ve always lived up to the ideals that were being articulated in this place at that moment, but as projects like <a href="https://viraltexts.org/">Viral Texts</a> developed, I worked to ensure graduate students who worked on the project were treated like collaborators. One reason the project may seem from the outside to have veered in so many directions is that we have defined our lines of inquiry around the aptitudes and interests of graduate student collaborators who have joined us for a few years at a time, students such as <a href="https://abbymullen.org/">Abby Mullen</a>, <a href="https://jonathandfitzgerald.com/">Jonathan Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="https://www.averyblankenship.com/">Avery Blankenship</a>, or <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jaihyun-park">Jay Park</a>. Most of the articles we have written have been coauthored. Each chapter of <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/going-the-rounds">the book that we are currently taking far too long to write</a> is cowritten by at least one current or former graduate collaborator. The “career warping gravity”—as John Unsworth called it this morning—of DH at UVA shapes not only those who studied and worked here, but the students who work with all of us at institutions beyond.</p> <p>In many ways, I don’t see the Viral Texts project as one big project that we are building over many years—Viral Texts is not a singular thing. Instead, it has become more of a framework for gathering and supporting a series of smaller (dare I say, better scoped?) experiments with distinct, transcriptable outcomes for the collaborators involved with each individual experiment. Among its many technical achievements, I would argue one of the most transformative outcomes of the digital humanities, led by the work done here at UVA, has been pushing the humanities to reconsider normalized—but inequitable and unsustainable—collaborative structures in humanistic fields. A challenge in the coming decade is to take these reconsiderations on board even as the literal infrastructure for collaboration—that is, the departments, programs, and people—are further constrained and constricted.</p> <p>The past decade has been characterized by increasingly anxious conversations about the outcomes of humanities graduate education. We might think of the conversation about alt-ac careers, and then the backlash against that conversation. One thing I would suggest often gets missed in those anxious conversations is that it’s not really the <em>skills</em> learned in humanities study that are at issue. As humanists insist in departmental mission statements or pitches to prospective students, learning to closely attend to detail—whether of text or data—and express your ideas about those details effectively are valuable skills across both academic and private sectors. Adding technical skills to the mix can be valuable, but that in and of itself doesn’t, I would suggest, change career dynamics much.</p> <p>Instead, I would suggest that the <em>modes</em> we teach students for using the skills they cultivate in graduate school remain cloistered in ways that mitigate against students using those skills across domains. Most graduate students are not learning how to organize projects comprising team members who come from diverse domains, who bring diverse skills. They are not learning what fair collaboration looks like in practice. They are not learning one important outcome of cross-field collaboration we discuss less often as an explicit goal: how to articulate your goals and vision for a project to partners who bring distinct goals and visions, and identify the intersections. DH has been an exception here. Perhaps more than the technical skills DH students learn, they are more likely to learn how to translate their intellectual work and see its value in contexts beyond their own minds.</p> <p>Collaboration isn’t just a thing in DH. Collaboration is THE thing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ryan Cordell</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The following remarks were prepared for the 30 Years of Digital Humanities at UVA conference, as part of a panel on “DH, Graduate Education, Careers.”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Article: Newspapers and Periodicals</title><link href="https://ryancordell.org/research/newspapersperiodicals/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Article: Newspapers and Periodicals"/><published>2022-09-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://ryancordell.org/research/Newspapers-and-Periodicals</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ryancordell.org/research/newspapersperiodicals/"><![CDATA[<p>I’m happy to have another essay I wrote <em>pre-pandemic</em> out now out. “Newspapers and Periodicals” can be found in the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/american-literature-in-transition-18511877/E430E62A0B8486C90FA68FD6A0666A7A"><em>American Literature in Transition, 1851-1877</em></a>.

Praise and ironic critique intertwine in his critical writings, as in subsequent paragraphs of this review, where he describes the engraving “Dacota Woman and the Assiniboin Girl” as “worthy of all commendation,” while another engraving in the same issue, “The Love Letter,” “has the air of having been carved by a very small child, with a dull knife, from a raw potato.”<sup id="fnref:poe2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:poe2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> If Poe marks a genuine trend toward periodical forms of literature in the period, he also stages an ambiguous response to the trend, vacillating between praise and condemnation.</p> <p>In another line bordering on irony, Poe cautions, in his capacity as its new editor of <em>The Broadway Journal</em> newspaper, that the “lightness of the artillery” in this “Magazine-ward” age “must not degenerate into pop-gunnery—by which character we may designate the character of the greater portion of the newspaper press; whose sole legitimate object is the discussion of ephemeral matters in an ephemeral manner.” This line is particularly ironic because this entire paragraph from Poe’s review of <em>Graham’s Magazine</em> recycles much of its prose from another review Poe penned—this one of the <em>American Review</em>—for another newspaper—<em>The Evening Mirror</em>—less than a month prior. On February 12, 1845, Poe had written:</p> <blockquote> <p>The increase within a few years, of our Magazine literature, is by no means to be regarded as indicating what some critics would suppose it to indicate—a downward tendency in American taste, or in American letters. It is but a sign of the times—and indication of an era in which men are forced upon the curt, the condensed, the well-digested—in a word upon journalism in lieu of dissertation. We need now the light artillery more especially than the Peace-Makers of the intellect. We will not be sure that men at present think more profoundly than half a century ago, but beyond question they think with more rapidity, with <em>more skill</em>, with more <em>tact</em>, and with an infinitely more of methods in the thought. Besides all this they have a vast increase in what Coleridge terms the material for thinking—they have more facts—they have <em>more to think about</em>. For this reason they are disposed to put the greatest amount of thought in the smallest compass, and disperse it with the utmost attainable rapidity. Hence the <em>journalism</em> of the age—hence, in especial, the Magazines.<sup id="fnref:poe2001" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:poe2001" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Journalism for Poe is “curt,” “condensed,” and “well-digested”: qualities which make periodical literature likewise portable, excerptible, reproducible, recyclable. The rapid proliferation of “material for thinking,” across an ever-shifting field of publications, allows for, even necessitates, frequency, redundancy, and iteration. For contemporary scholars looking back at this period, the ramified conditions of nineteenth-century periodical literature might lead us to consider its textual field in terms of aggregation and cumulation, rather than as a collection of singular works. As a collective endeavor, nineteenth-century periodical literature operates in ways Poe and many of his contemporaries found distinct.</p> <p>Several of the key phrases in Poe’s essay appear elsewhere in the periodical literature of the period. For instance, one of the most widely-reprinted selections of the nineteenth-century was a advertorial (i.e. an advertisement that takes the form of an editorial), <a href="http://128.31.27.206/clusters/gtr.html/18510710-sn84023200-Newspapers.html">most often titled simply “Newspapers,”</a> which was reprinted between the 1830s and 1890s. “Newspapers” claims to transcribe a recollection of Judge Augustus Baldwin Longstreet—though in some reprintings the memory is ascribed to Daniel Webster—about “what a difference there was between those of my schoolmates who had, and those who had not, access to newspapers. Other things being equal, the first were always decidedly superior to the last, in debate and composition at least. The reason,” Longstreet/Webster insists, “is plain—they had command of more facts” (<em>Vermont Watchman and State Journal</em>, 10 July 1851). Likewise <a href="http://128.31.27.206/clusters/gtr.html/18530719-sn86053240-InterestingStatistics.html">a column of “Interesting Statistics”</a> about the world, reprinted between 1853-1899, was frequently titled “<em>Many Facts</em> in Small Compass” (my emphasis), claiming by that title the kind of distilled knowledge Poe ascribes to the best periodical literature. The facts that follow in this column may seem far removed from the literary (e.g. “The whole number of languages spoken in the world amount to 3,064; viz., 587 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.—The inhabitants of our globe profess more than 1,000 different religions.”), but for Poe and many of his contemporaries these boundaries were less clear. Facts and journalism fall under the capacious heading “Magazine literature” and are, alongside other forms of periodical literature, “signs of the times.” Like the periodicals in which they appear, facts operate cumulatively: it is through collecting many facts that readers benefit, rather than through intensive focus on a small number.</p> <p>This chapter considers nineteenth-century American periodicals as networked, transitional media, both producers and aggregators of a vibrant, hybrid store of everyday reading and writing. In the nineteenth-century US, newspapers and magazines were paradoxical media: simultaneously local and (inter)national, partisan and heterogeneous, original and formulaic. Texts of all kinds circulated through the “exchanges system,” as newspaper editors traded “selections” for in-kind reprinting. Newspaper exchanges were sponsored, at least indirectly, by the US government, which worked to keep postage cheap for mailing newspapers to ensure information spread across the country. Alongside political news, however, readers found a miscellany of reprinted recipes, household tips, popular science, jokes, moral lessons, fiction, or poetry. Such selections came primarily from other newspapers, but editors also lifted texts from magazines and books—and neither were magazine editors above reprinting a poem that had been lauded while “going the rounds” of the newspapers. In the nineteenth century, newspapers and periodicals were primary vehicles for circulating information and popular literature together, and these broad categories commingled in interstitial genres such as the vignette. Periodicals offered a liminal space between the political, the social, and the literary where ideas of authorship, genre, and value were contested and reshaped.</p> <h2 id="the-periodical-form">The Periodical Form</h2> <p>Periodicals, both today and in the nineteenth century, are paradoxical media. As James Mussell has argued, they rely simultaneously on predictability and novelty. To continually engage readers, periodicals must publish issues each day, week, or month: each with new texts that speak to current events—especially in the case of the newspaper—while providing new information or amusements. At the same time, each issue must resemble others in its series. Any given periodical issue stands in a line of succession, typically numbered so it can be situated with prior and subsequent issues, while its text often references past issues or points to future installments. As Mussell describes, “No issue of a serial ever exists on its own but calls up the memory of its predecessors while projecting its successors into the future…As one issue displaces another, a publication’s editor must avoid too much difference while supplying just the right amount of the same.”<sup id="fnref:mussell2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mussell2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p> <p>In addition to references that tie together periodicals’ content across issues, the form of periodicals is predictable, as many titles, ads, and other boilerplate texts remain stable from issue to issue, as do conventions of formatting, layout, and organization that help readers reliably navigate a given title over time. An editor’s introduction to the issue, for instance, might appear on the same page in each issue, so that the “larger serial structure is invoked through the repetition of certain formal features, issue after issue” as the periodical “insists on formal continuity, repeated from the past and projected onwards into the future, providing a mediating framework whose purpose is to reconcile difference by presenting new content in a form already known to readers.” For Mussell, “This repetitive formal framework…allows readers to differentiate between form and content, regarding form as that which stays the same and allowing content, which varies, to flow” (pg. 347-348). Too much novelty and a periodical is not recognizable as one entity; too much duplication and it cannot sustain interest from readers.</p> <p>Both the possible forms and the content of periodicals expanded exponentially during the nineteenth century. The newspaper, while not new to the period, was a medium reinvented by a combination of technical, social, and political factors that reshaped and exponentially expanded the newspaper landscape. In his <em>Autobiography</em>, Benjamin Franklin notes with some pride that in 1771 there were “five-and-twenty” newspapers in the American colonies. By Tocqueville’s visit to the United States in the 1830s there were around nine hundred,<sup id="fnref:nord2006" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nord2006" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> which expanded even still in the coming decades so there were “over 4,000 dailies and weeklies in 1860…about 5,820 in 1870,” and up to “11,314 in 1880.”<sup id="fnref:smythe2003" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:smythe2003" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Technically, this expansion was possible because of several linked inventions. First, the development of more efficient iron and then rotary presses, many eventually powered by steam or electric motors, allowed far more sheets to be printed with fewer workers than had the wooden presses of the previous centuries. This increased speed, however, only became possible with the introduction of industrial methods for paper production and then, in the 1860s, reliable methods for making paper from cheap wood pulp rather than costly rags.<sup id="fnref:woodpulp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:woodpulp" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p> <p>Socially, the dramatic expansion of newspapers stemmed, at least in part, from the medium’s tie to partisanship. Newspapers in the mid-nineteenth century were, most typically, political organs, edited by a party appointee and primarily dedicated to advancing a given party’s agenda. As such, increasingly most towns in the United States had not one but (at least) two newspapers: one for each of the major parties. Much of the column space in such newspapers was given over to political reporting and advocacy, including detailed breakdowns of how readers should vote when election cycles neared. As the United States expanded its territories, so to did the partisan press expand, often in advance of formal territorial boundaries.</p> <p>There was a narrow subset of American newspapers devoted entirely to politics, as in the fictional paper from Fanny Fern’s novel <em>Ruth Hall</em>, which “seldom contains anything but politics.”<sup id="fnref:fern1855" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fern1855" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> The majority of U.S. newspapers, however, rarely filled their pages entirely with political material, except (perhaps) in the days immediately preceding or following elections. Instead, most papers in this period were thoroughly hybrid in form, printing texts across a wide range of genres: from news and opinion to recipes, trivia, popular science, domestic advice, travel narratives, fiction, or poetry. The newspaper, like its close cousin the magazine, was a miscellany that entertained and informed, meeting both practical and poetic needs for its readers. Those readers included, at the very least, all the members of a middle-class family, as selections were often introduced as particularly written for fathers, mothers, or children, all of whom were expected to engage, in series, with a family’s subscription. This newspaper miscellany was not created through a particular technology, but instead through a social agreement among editors and reliant on loose intellectual property laws: the newspaper exchange system.</p> <h2 id="the-exchanges-system">The Exchanges System</h2> <p>Under the pseudonym Fanny Fern, Sara Payson Willis became one of the most well known authors in nineteenth-century America. Fern wrote primarily about domestic life, moving skillfully between sentiment and sardonicism in her depictions of middle-class people wooing, marrying—or, occasionally <em>not</em> marrying—socializing, gossiping, and parenting. When she signed an exclusive contract with the <em>New York Ledger</em>—a “story paper” that was itself something between a newspaper and magazine—in 1855, Fern became the highest-paid columnist, and one of the highest-paid authors, in the United States. Before that contract was signed, however, Fern wrote for a number other publications, such as the <em>True Flag</em>, <em>Olive Branch</em>, <em>Home Journal</em>, and <em>Musical World and Times</em>, as well as publishing successful collections of her columns in books such as <em>Fern Leaves from Fanny’s Portfolio</em> (1853) or <em>Fresh Leaves</em> (1857).<sup id="fnref:mcmullena" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mcmullena" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Fern built her reputation on these publications, but especially from the widespread reprinting of her columns in newspapers across the country, and indeed around the world. When Fern published a piece in a periodical such as the <em>Home Journal</em>, it would appear over the next weeks and months in the local newspapers of readers from New York to Hawaii, all points in between, and some beyond.<sup id="fnref:homestead2001" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:homestead2001" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p> <p>Some of Fern’s early columns circulated without her real or pen-name attached, though Fern was savvy about collecting those columns in books such as <em>Fern Leaves</em> as a way of reclaiming credit for her popular writing. This was the case for “A Word To Mothers,” a short parenting column which was reprinted in at least 90 periodicals in the US, UK, and Australia between June of 1852 and the end of the century (though the bulk of these reprints were published in the two decades following its appearance). This vignette recounts a scene between a mother and her young daughter, who confesses to breaking a vase. The mother scolds and punishes her daughter for the offense, but the column’s oracular voice chastises the mother for choosing a strict judgment rather than valuing her child’s honesty. “[A]t that moment,” the article asserts, “was crushed in her little heart the sweet flower of truth.”<sup id="fnref:fern1853" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fern1853" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p> <p>As this selection circulated, editors dramatically shortened it, from six paragraphs in the original to only 2-3 in the majority of newspaper reprintings. “A Word to Mothers is Typical” is quite typical of Fern’s more sincere columns, which often offered parental advice and assumed a pedagogical voice. As a pared-down newspaper selection, the vignette is likewise typical of the texts that circulated through the practice of reprinting in nineteenth-century newspapers. The abbreviated scene between mother and daughter seems to recount a real exchange, a moment drawn from life and recounted journalistically. The central characters are not named, however, and so are not specifically identifiable by newspaper readers, while the text’s tidy moral lesson casts the literal veracity of the scene into doubt. The scene borrows from journalism and fiction, operating in the gray area between the two. Nineteenth-century readers, however, were likely untroubled by the inclusion of such a scene in their newspapers, which were full of similar selections that blurred the boundaries between literal and emotional truth, or between information and entertainment. Many such texts circulated through reprinting and were among the most widely read texts of the period.</p> <p>During the nineteenth-century, the material printed in newspapers was not protected by copyright or intellectual property law. The laws and even the postal system were designed to facilitate the ready sharing of newspapers among editors, who subscribed to each other’s papers, paying little to no postage for the privilege. In fact, nineteenth-century editors thought of themselves as parts of an “exchange system” that linked periodicals around the country in a network of shared labor and in-kind use. Editors in the period maintained exchange lists that detailed those papers to which they subscribed, as well as the papers that subscribed to their publication in turn. When editors received papers from their exchange partners in the mail, they combed through them in search of salient texts—what they called “selections”—for republication.</p> <p>A selection chosen for a particular newspaper was cut out of the paper in which an editor found it, pasted to a board, and given to the compositors who were setting the type for the next issue, who used it to reset the selection for reprinting in their paper. When a selection could not be immediately used—and so long as it was not time sensitive, which was a different calculation in the years before instantaneous communications at a distance—then it was sorted for later use, sometimes organized by length with other scissored selections. The literature of newspaper selection included genres such as poetry and fiction, but also a much broader swathe of brief, occasional writing. Consider the very brief advice column often titled <a href="http://128.31.27.206/clusters/gtr.html/18520309-sn85026466-FourGoodHabits.html">“Four Points” or “Four Good Habits”</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>FOUR GOOD HABITS.—There were four good habits a wise and good man earnestly recommended in his counsels and by his own example, and which he considered essentially necessary for the happy management of temporal concerns—these are punctuality, accuracy, steadiness, and despatch. Without the first, time is wasted, those who rely on us are irritated and disappointed, and nothing is done in its proper time and place. Without the second, mistakes the most hurtful to our own credit and interest, and that of others, may be committed. Without the third, nothing can be well done; and, without the fourth, opportunities of advantage are lost which it is impossible to recall. (<em>Grand River Times</em>, 9 March 1852)</p> </blockquote> <p>This selection was reprinted in nearly 200 newspapers around the world. Though the introduction vaguely implies the recommended habits are reported from “a wise and good man,” the broadness of this characterization lends the text an aphoristic quality. Newspapers were full of similar advice on conduct, marriage, childrearing, business, and more. The succinct and easily transferrable lessons of such texts contributed to their wide circulation and republication.</p> <p>When editors noticed particular selections reprinted across many of their exchange papers, they often described those texts as “going the rounds”—a phrase that recalls in its very construction the way we describe twenty-first-century memes “going viral” online. On January 23, 1869, for instance, the Californian newspaper the <em>Shasta Courier</em> reprinted the following, which appeared also in more than 80 other periodicals:</p> <blockquote> <p>At one time a woman could hardly walk through the streets of San Francisco without having every one pause to gaze at her, and a child was so rare, that once in a theatre, in the same city, when a woman had taken her infant, when it began to cry, just as the orchestra began to play, a man in the pit cried out: “Stop those fiddles and let the baby cry. I haven’t heard such a sound for ten years.” The audience applauded this sentiment, the orchestra stopped, and the baby continued its performance, amid unbounded enthusiasm.</p> </blockquote> <p>This short paragraph seeks to illustrate the gender—and thus family—imbalances of life in the western United States, where a crying infant might be welcomed as a reminder of normalcy for men too long isolated. In this case, however, the <em>Shasta Courier</em> prefaces its reprinting with a single, ironical sentence: “The following florid item is going the rounds of the Eastern press.” By describing the text as “florid,” the <em>Courier</em> dismisses it as overstated and “the Eastern press” as too gullible in reprinting it so often. By describing the text as “going the rounds,” the <em>Courier</em> uses a common editorial phrase of the period that pointed to a selection’s wide circulation and readership; the <em>Courier</em>’s editor noticed this text printed in many of his exchange papers and, despite his reservations, he perpetuated the cycle by bringing the text to his readers’ attention. Like the phrase “going viral” today, the phrase “going the rounds” disavows editors’ agency in selection and reprinting, implying that certain texts move from paper to paper entirely of their own accord: all while allowing editors to include a popular selection in their papers and pass it along to any newspapers on their own exchange list.</p> <p>Going the rounds of the newspapers was a complex and messy mode of distribution. As they circulated, editors and compositors modified newspaper selections for length, making them shorter or longer to fit a gap on a newspaper page, and also for content, adjusting the selection’s text to better align with the paper’s political or social program. Citation practices—whether in regards to a text’s author or the source of a given reprinting—were irregular at best. As Kevin Barnhust and John Nerone note,</p> <blockquote> <p>In the editor’s newspaper, items were haphazardly attributed. Sometimes editors made a point of mentioning an item’s source, but just as often they might fudge it, pretending to have had more direct access to an item than in fact they did. Even more typically, the editor simply would not care particularly about attributing an item. In the age of postal transmission, with the wide and gratis sharing of news items, saying where an item had originated had little importance.<sup id="fnref:barnhurst2002" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:barnhurst2002" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>In prior work, I have discussed the ways Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story “The Celestial Railroad” was coopted by the religious press for purposes contrary to his own wishes,<sup id="fnref:cordell2013" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cordell2013" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>, while in another article Abby Mullen and I demonstrate how the newspapers’ uneven citation practices extended to newspaper poetry. As poems went the rounds, editors and readers debated the authorship of anonymous texts, while the names of famous literary authors were sometimes substituted for regional authors or appended to unclaimed poems.<sup id="fnref:cordell2017b" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cordell2017b" class="footnote" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> An example of this tendency is illustrated by <a href="http://128.31.27.206/clusters/gtr.html/18600301-sn82014141-TheOldCanoe.html">“The Old Canoe,”</a> a very popular periodical poem in the period. The poem is a nostalgic ode to the titular canoe, which the speaker remembers fondly from childhood. The poem’s nostalgia is most clear in the final stanza:</p> <blockquote> <p>But now as I lean o’er the crumbling side,<br/> And look below in the sluggish tide,<br/> The face that I see there is graver grown,<br/> And the laugh that I hear has a sobered tone,<br/> And the hand that lent to the light skiff wings<br/> Have grown familiar with sterner things;<br/> But I love to think of the hours that flew,<br/> As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,<br/> Ere the blossoms waved, or the green moss grew,<br/> O’er the mouldering stern of the old canoe. from the <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016836/1860-03-22/ed-1/seq-1/print/image_600x600_from_1505%2C2052_to_2483%2C5591/"><em>St. Cloud Democrat</em>, 1 March 1860</a></p> </blockquote> <p>“The Old Canoe” was written by Vermont poet Emily Rebecca Page, but as it circulated in newspapers it became a “fugitive verse” of disputed authorship, and was often attributed to other (typically more famous) writers or, even more typically, printed without an author’s name attached.</p> <p>When the <em>St. Cloud Democrat</em> reprinted “The Old Canoe” in March 1862, they included this introduction: “The following beautiful lines have been going the rounds of newspaperdom for several years without credit. Whoever the author is, and we confess our inability to name him, he should claim the wandering progeny of bis brain, as they are worthy of the palmiest days of genuine poetry.” Of particular note are that the poem is described “going the rounds of newspaperdom,” wandering authorless from periodical to periodical, and that the <em>St. Cloud Democrat</em> assumes the author is a man, despite the fact that a significant proportion of newspaper poetry was written by women. Of the nearly 200 reprints of “The Old Canoe” identified by the <em>Viral Texts</em> project, the majority are printed without an attributed author’s name, so that most of the poem’s readers shared the <em>St. Cloud Democrat</em>’s conundrum.</p> <p>As a vehicle for the circulation of literature, then, the newspaper exchange system was uncertain and heady, driven by the needs of editors for daily or weekly content moreso than by the needs of authors for fame or income. Nevertheless, in her autobiographical novel <em>Ruth Hall</em>, Fern outlines the importance of republication through the exchange system for an unknown writer in the period:</p> <blockquote> <p>“I have good news for you,” said Mr. Lescom [Ruth Hall’s editor] to Ruth, at her next weekly visit; “your very first articles are copied, I see, into many of my exchanges, even into the —————, which seldom contains anything but politics. A good sign for you, Mrs. Hall; a good test of your popularity.” Ruth’s eyes sparkled, and her whole face glowed.<sup id="fnref:fern18552" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fern18552" class="footnote" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Such reprinting did not translate immediately to financial security, as Fern acknowledges a few pages later when she writes, “Months passed away, while Ruth hoped and toiled,” her “fame as a writer increasing much faster than her renumeration.” In the novel’s fictional case as in Fern’s own, however, the fame secured through the newspaper exchanges could be turned toward more secure employment (pg. 255). Of course, in a system as large as the exchanges system, there were bound to be a few such success stories amid a great many more authors whose work circulated, even successfully, without such recognition or renumeration. In another parallel to today’s internet culture, the nineteenth-century periodical relied on a steady stream of material produced by unpaid or under-compensated producers.</p> <h3 id="media-permeability">Media Permeability</h3> <p>Scholars often point to the importance of literary magazines such as the <em>North American Review</em>, the <em>Southern Literary Messenger</em>, <em>Putnam’s Monthly</em>, or <em>Graham’s Magazine</em> to the development of American literature during the nineteenth-century. Certainly these were some of the magazines Poe had in mind when he wrote of the “tendency of the age…Magazine-ward.” However, because of the generic hybridity of the period’s newspapers, fostered by the reprinting practices described above, literary culture diffused far beyond the rarified sphere of high culture magazines. In fact, the line between newspapers and magazines was itself less clear than we might imagine from twentieth- or twenty-first-century examples. Magazines were typically longer, thematically more focused, and less frequently published from newspapers, but none of these characteristics applied in all cases. Periodicals as a class might also be considered a liminal space, with individual publications falling somewhere along a continuum between “newspaperness” and “magazinehood.” Literature of many kinds appeared across that spectrum, including in publications where modern readers might not expect to find literature, such as <em>Scientific American</em>.</p> <p>On its current website and in its printed magazines, <em>Scientific American</em> claims to be “the longest continuously published magazine in the U.S.” and “the world’s leading source and authority for science and technology information for science-interested citizens, delivering understandable, credible and provocative content to an audience of more than 5 million people worldwide.” However, the magazine was founded in 1845 with much a narrower focus and format. While by the early twentieth century <em>Scientific American</em> was clearly a magazine in the modern sense, issued monthly with elaborate illustrations, in its first decades it was more akin to a newspaper, with which it shared its short length—first four, and then eight pages per issue—weekly publication schedule, and tight format—four columns per page. Over the years the periodical incorporated more and more illustrations but in its first years these were relatively simple, primarily woodcuts that illustrated the primary patents each issue described. <em>Scientific American</em>’s images were less elaborate, in fact, than those found in illustrated newspapers, such as <em>Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper</em>, another medium from the period that complicates the newspaper/magazine dichotomy.</p> <p><em>Scientific American</em>’s founding editor, Rufus Porter, embodied the journal’s eclecticism. Porter was a prolific inventor who, according to one obituary, worked on “turbine water wheels, windmills, flying ships, rotary engines, and sundry contrivances for abolishing as far as possible agricultural labor,” as well as “war engines,” “clocks, railway signals, churns, washing machines, and other appliances,” all while also working, at times, as schoolmaster and portrait painter. This laudation, which <em>Scientific American</em> claims to reprint from “One of our English contemporaries,” also praises Porter for founding “the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, the greatest and best of all American mechanical papers, and one that indeed is unsurpassed in its new lines by any journal extant.”<sup id="fnref:anonymous1884" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:anonymous1884" class="footnote" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> In describing <em>Scientific American</em> as a “mechanical <em>paper</em>” (my emphasis) this article points back, perhaps deliberately, to the publication’s format when Porter founded it, when it resembled newspaper contemporaries more so than other magazines. Porter only ran the journal a few years, but it continued to be a hybrid publication, blending the mechanical and practical with the cultural and political.</p> <p>Subscribers to <em>Scientific American</em> would receive a cover for each volume of the publication, so that, when all the issues of a given volume had been received, they could bind all the numbers together. Those individual numbers, however, quite closely resembled the newspapers of the period. Most prominent in any issue would be reports of new patents filed at the U.S. Patent Office, as can be seen in the first issue of the periodical’s second volume, issued on 26 September 1846. The primary story on the front page of this issue describes a a new musical instrument, the “viol seraphine,” and includes a woodcut illustration of the device, its parts labeled as in a patent application. From 1859 <em>Scientific American</em> operated a patent agency in Washington, D.C. to help inventors file with the patent office and (of course) to generate new content for the paper.</p> <p>In addition to its patent reports, however, <em>Scientific American</em> published a wide variety of material, including news; jokes; travel narratives; history, poetry; fiction; and, of course, other columns describing scientific, medical, and technological wonders. Just to the left of the “viol seraphine” in the issue described above one finds the paper’s poetry column, itself headed by a woodcut that implies this is a regular feature of the paper. On the next page, a woodcut heads the “Variety” section, which likewise includes a range of informational and literary material, while on page five a similar device frames the “Latest News,” a column implying the currency of a newspaper rather than the slower pace of a magazine. These woodcuts recur in issue after issue of the paper, providing the serial structure framing ever-shifting texts of the weekly publication.</p> <p>In its miscellany, <em>Scientific American</em> most resembles its newspaper contemporaries, which, as Sari Edelstein, increasingly “appealed to…populations looking to the press for a blend of information and amusement.”<sup id="fnref:edelstein2014" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:edelstein2014" class="footnote" rel="footnote">17</a></sup> Indeed, in advertisements from <em>Scientific American</em>’s first decades—often printed in newspapers—the publication was touted as “the best mechanical <em>paper</em> in the world” (my emphasis), a tagline that highlights the publication’s hybrid identity as both technological journal and newspaper. <em>Scientific American</em> was a “mechanical journal” in two senses: both a central source of popular scientific and technological information during the period and, as a newspaper in the exchange system, an exemplar of the increasing mechanization of news during the period.</p> <p>Among the magazines and journals studied in the <em>Viral Texts</em> project<sup id="fnref:magazines" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:magazines" class="footnote" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>, <em>Scientific American</em> is most closely aligned with the newspapers, exchanging more frequently with the newspapers than most other magazines. While newspapers often reprinted material from magazines, borrowing poems or short stories as they would from other exchanges papers, <em>Scientific American</em> exchanged in both directions with newspapers: it was a both a frequent source of popularly-reprinted selections and it reproduced popular selections from other newspapers. Between its founding and the end of the nineteenth century, <em>Scientific American</em> reprinted tens of thousands of texts in common with its newspaper contemporaries. Given that it was a weekly publication, like many newspapers, the editors of <em>Scientific American</em> no doubt faced many of the same production challenges faced by their newspaper contemporaries. Their reports on current patents were not sufficient to make up four or eight weekly pages, and so they required regular content of other kinds to fill their columns. For this <em>Scientific American</em> turned too to the exchange system, which helped provide that content and, in turn, distributed their articles around the country and beyond.</p> <p>In addition to these practical similarities, however, I would also identify an ideological convergence driving the close relationship between <em>Scientific American</em> and the newspapers. <em>Scientific American</em> emerged into a marketplace increasingly captivated by those genres I have elsewhere named “information literature”: lists, tables, recipes, scientific reports, trivia columns, and so forth. One such piece, <a href="http://128.31.27.206/clusters/gtr.html/18480701-SciAm-MedicalUsesOfSalt.html">“Medical Uses of Salt,”</a> was first published in <em>Scientific American</em> in July 1848. This long selection attempts to show readers the great value of “simple salt,” which “is almost a cure for every thing,” even in cases where more exotic medicines “from the Persian Gulf or the wilds of Hinduostan” fail. While in many ways the remedies in this article resembles folk medicine rather than what we might call “science,” <em>Scientific American</em> was full of such pieces, printed alongside its expositions of current inventions and sharing with them a kind of authority granted by the publication and its patent office. While this particular remedy seems to have appeared first in <em>Scientific American</em>, similar texts appeared in most periodicals of the period.</p> <p>Rhetorically, <em>Scientific American</em> maintains a contradictory relationship with the newspapers, both decrying the scientific inaccuracies that it claims propagates through reprinting and, simultaneously, reprinting from newspapers liberally. For instance, on 16 December 1868 <em>Scientific American</em> reprinted a short selection claiming one could “purify a room” by setting a pitcher of water in it to “absorb all the respired gases” in it. This piece appeared in nearly 300 publications around the world, but <em>Scientific American</em> reproduces it “as a specimen of the erroneous character of many things which ‘go the rounds’ of the press.” When the editors in this example admonish their correspondent (and, by implication, their readers) that they “must not expect scientific accuracy in the benighted daily press. We have long since ceased to expect it,” they elide <em>Scientific American’s</em> own active participation in helping the newspapers’ information literature “go the rounds of the press.” <em>Scientific American</em> is frequency added to bylines by the newspapers that reprint from it—more frequently than the uneven citation practices of the period might predict—in order to claim some of the newspaper-journal’s authority. In the case of this particular home remedy, we find that just a few years earlier, on 28 February 1863, <em>Scientific American</em> printed this same piece but assessed it slightly more favorably, noting that “it contains some truth, but more error.” This earlier reprinting highlights the permeable boundary between a periodical like <em>Scientific American</em> and the newspaper press—nearly all periodicals in the period served some role in the exchanges system, even when a given publication formally denounced it.</p> <p>Even outside its explicitly literary sections, like its poetry corner, <em>Scientific American</em> circulated texts that toe a literary line. For instance, <a href="http://128.31.27.206/clusters/gtr.html/18451113-sn84023209-Mechanic.html">“The Mechanic”</a> was, in one view, a very short story with a moral that was reprinted in nearly 200 newspapers in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. It appeared in the 16 October, 1845 issue of <em>Scientific American</em>, which is quite early in the text’s circulation history. “The Mechanic” embodies a prevalent newspaper genre we on the <em>Viral Texts</em> research team have deemed the <em>vignette</em>.<sup id="fnref:vignette" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vignette" class="footnote" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> These are very short prose pieces that borrow from journalistic conventions, gesturing toward specificity or facticity, but they offer few verifiable facts, much like the Fanny Fern column “A Word to Mothers” described earlier. Vignettes unfold in a single scene, without a change of setting, and include a single set of characters, typically only two. Finally, they offer a tidy resolution in the form of either punchline, a lesson, or a moral.</p> <p>In its first paragraph, “The Mechanic” outlines a scene between a young woman and suitor that could be drawn directly from a sentimental novel of the period:</p> <blockquote> <p>A young man commenced visiting a young woman, and appeared to be well received. One evening he called at the house when it was quite late, which led the girl to inquire where he had been. “I had to work late to-night,” he replied. “Do you work for a living?” inquired the astonished girl. “Certainly,” replied the young man, “I am a mechanic.” “My brother doesn’t work,” she remarked, “and I dislike the name of a mechanic,” and she turned her pretty nose. (<em>Scientific American</em> 16 October 1845)</p> </blockquote> <p>From this opening, “The Mechanic” becomes a didactic piece, a lesson in humility and respect for honest work. In its second paragraph, readers learn that this was the last interview between this young man and woman, and that afterwards the mechanic became “a wealthy man” with “one of the best women for a wife,” while the haughty woman became “the wife of a miserable tool”—pun, we want to presume, very intended—and drunkard. The woman is “obliged to take in washing in order to support herself and children.” The final paragraph of “The Mechanic” addresses readers directly, warning them to “beware how you treat young men who work for a living” while defending “honest industry” as an American ideal that should be respected.</p> <p><em>Scientific American</em> does not seem to be the first periodical to publish “The Mechanic,” though it is the first we have thus far identified in the <em>Viral Texts</em> project. It signs its reprinting of the piece with “<em>Ex.</em>”: a signal that it selected the text from one of its exchanges. The connection between this selection and this publication, however, seems particularly clear and strong. A paper described in its masthead as “The Advocate of Industry and Enterprise, and Journal of Mechanical and Other Improvements” no doubt imagines many of its readers as mechanics, and would seek to promote the value of their work by republishing this selection. Here, however, I want “The Mechanic” to stand in for <em>Scientific American</em>’s complex relationship with literature and its newspaper contemporaries.</p> <p>This selection is a thoroughly typical example of newspaper literature, borrowing freely from literary, journalistic, editorial, and other textual traditions. As a vignette, it appears as simultaneously factual and fictional, a perfect anecdote well suited to circulate among newspapers and periodicals in this period. It employs literary shorthand, relying on readers’ understanding of sentimental and domestic fiction to fill in the edges of its single-paragraph story. Just as the lines between media were permeable in nineteenth century, within periodicals lines between genres were permeable and regularly traversed. In many accounts of periodical fiction, a piece like “The Mechanic” might be overlooked, but a full account of newspapers and magazines role in literary culture must account for these slippages between genre, taking widely-circulated, anonymous, often practically-oriented texts seriously as vital context for the more recognizable literature of the period. Writers like Fanny Fern composed alongside and in dialogue with pieces like “The Mechanic,” and their short stories and poems circulated in the same heady, messy exchange networks.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The nineteenth-century media landscape was suffused by newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals. For many readers, these media were their primary sources of both information and entertainment. The lines between these media were messy and frequently crossed, as were the boundaries between genres of writing. Explicitly literary genres such as poetry and fiction appeared alongside a smorgasbord of informational, editorial, and journalistic genres, and texts borrowed ideas, tropes, and stylistic features from each other across all conceivable divisions. Readers encountered any given work in many different textual forms, framed by diverse paratextual contexts, and within distinct communities instantiated by regional, national, or international publication networks. For scholars of the nineteenth century, the key insight from studying periodical culture might be, quite simply, that nineteenth-century texts are highly networked objects that must be interpreted in terms of variation, circulation, and multiplicity rather than as singular works.</p> <p>In attempting to account for this hybrid, expansive textual field, scholars often focus—as I have several times in this chapter—to specific authors (e.g. Poe, Fern), publications (e.g. <em>Scientific American</em>), or texts. This approach is both understandable and sensible; one compelling way to grapple with the broad contours of periodicals’ operations is through such intensive focus. By restricting our focus to particular facets of the period’s exchange and production systems, we build models for understanding other authors, publications, or texts at work alongside the chosen exemplar. The challenge, however, is that each time we home in on one facet of the periodicals system, we risk losing sight of the group and network dynamics that defined periodical textuality in the period: and thus losing sight of the dynamics that defined a great deal of the period’s literature. Taking newspapers and magazines seriously requires a double view: both particular and collective, intensively local and globally networked. The experiences of nineteenth-century editors, writers, and readers were multiplied across these vectors, and our scholarly approaches must be as well.</p> <p>In closing, I return to Poe’s declaration that “[t]he whole tendency of” his age was toward a periodical sensibility. If we want to take this claim seriously—and there are certainly arguments to be made that we shouldn’t—then studying this period requires us to take seriously “the curt, the condensed, the pointed,” and “the readily diffused” alongside, and in essential dialogue with, “the verbose, the detailed,” and “the voluminous”—I will leave aside “the inaccessible”—that might describe more typical objects of literary analysis. Our accounts of specific periodical literature might themselves be more curt, condensed, and pointed, as we range across textual fields, attempting to describe the messy intertextuality of literary publication, circulation, and reception in nineteenth-century newspapers and magazines.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:poe2006" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Edgar Allan Poe, <em>The Portable Edgar Allan Poe</em>, ed.

I enjoyed many aspects of writing this piece, not least getting the chance to focus on more contemporary artifacts than I do typically, starting with a rumination on server farms located in nineteenth-century paper mills and expanding from there. I’m also particularly attached to the long inventory of digital-material artifacts midway through the essay.</p> <p>Per Cambridge University Press’ <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/open-access-books/green-open-access-policy-for-books">open access policies for edited collections</a>, I’m archiving a pre-print of my chapter here. This version does not reflect the edits made in response to the volume’s wonderful editors, Lu Ann De Cunzo and Catharine Dann Roeber, which improved the chapter’s structure substantially and added important connections to other chapters in the volume. The published version of this chapter, and the book, are available <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-material-culture-studies/1D27EF76C8FF1177E3552FC67A845128">from CUP</a>, while portions can be previewed <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RhlyEAAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">through Google Books</a>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="material-cultures-of-the-digital">Material Cultures of the Digital</h2> <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3> <p>When Google sought to expand its data center operations in 2009, the company bought an abandoned paper mill in Hamina, Finland. Built in 1953, the Summa Mill had been operated by Finnish pulp and paper manufacturer Stora Enso, but was closed in 2008 due to “a drop in newsprint and magazine-paper production” as “Newspapers and magazines are slowly giving way to web services along the lines of, well, Google.” According to <em>Wired</em> magazine, Google was interested in the mill because it “included an underground tunnel once used to pull water from the Gulf of Finland” to cool “a steam generation plant at the mill.” Google needed efficient and ecologically-friendly cooling systems, as well—not for a steam plant, but to cool the processors and other components in its massive servers. “Google’s Hamina data center is,” <em>Wired</em> declared, “the ideal metaphor for the digital age.”<sup id="fnref:metz2012" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:metz2012" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> We might recognize in <em>Wired</em>’s confident emblemizing of this factory a tidy narrative of new media in which the future necessarily subsumes the past, eliding the messier present.</p> <p>While popular-press accounts of Google’s paper mill purchase tended to claim the purchase illustrated the digital replacing its preceding media, it might instead remind us of the ways material cultures imbricate across time. Google purchased a space designed to produce one kind of information medium because its design, only slightly modified, would well serve the needs of a new information medium. Through this process the tech giant collapsed “analog” and “digital” material histories into one entwined narrative. As Alan Liu contends, narratives of new media too often hinge on ideas of replacement or conversion, while “The better term is indeed ‘encounter,’ indicating a thick, unpredictable zone of contact—more borderland than border line—where (mis)understandings of new media are negotiated along twisting, partial, and contradictory vectors.” In this encounter, the data center inhabits the paper mill, and the paper mill shapes—at least partially—the data center, a “<em>déjá vu</em> haunting of new by old media.”<sup id="fnref:liu2008b" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:liu2008b" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p> <p>Such encounters are everywhere in the histories of hardware and software. For instance, early internet companies like Prodigy and America Online relied on the infrastructure of the US Postal Service to distribute CD-ROMS of their software cheaply to potential users, as well as on the infrastructure of telephone lines to connect those users to the World Wide Web. More recently, Nicole Starsielski has traced the global fiberoptic network, a planet-spanning series of “winding cables the size of a garden hose” that run underground and undersea to “transport 99 percent of all transoceanic digital communications, including phone calls, text and e-mail messages, websites, digital images and video, and even some television.” Like Google’s paper mill-cum-server farm, the extensive infrastructure of the global internet often “follow…the contours of earlier networks, layered on top of earlier telegraph and telephone cables, power systems, lines of cultural immigration, and trade routes.”<sup id="fnref:starosielski2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:starosielski2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> We cannot consider the internet’s history or present without also considering the objects and people who have constituted its network, or indeed the previously existing networks the internet runs along or rides atop.</p> <p>A popular aphorism in the computing profession reads, “THERE IS NO CLOUD: It’s just someone else’s computer.” This phrase appears on laptop stickers and t-shirts, and on a bevy of coffee mugs found in computer science departments, tech conventions, and the offices of internet startups. This aphorism offers a wry reminder that for all the airy metaphors we use to discuss computation in the internet age, data doesn’t drift around the atmosphere. A computer is every bit as <em>material</em> an artifact as an abacus or printing press, as are the servers, cables, monitors, and other objects that make up the computational ecosystem. According to Tung-Hui Hu’s <em>A Prehistory of the Cloud</em>, “The cloud is both an idea and a physical and material object, and the more one learns about it, the more one realizes just how fragile it is.”<sup id="fnref:hu2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hu2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> It is incumbent on scholars of material culture across disciplines to learn about this constellation of objects we call the cloud if we are to account for this age.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we often talk of the newly ubiquitous “apparatus” of the digital age—to borrow N. Katherine Hayles’ word in <em>Writing Machines</em>—as if they were objects made of mist rather than metal, plastic, glass, and wire.<sup id="fnref:hayles2002" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hayles2002" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> In fact, the phrase “It’s just someone else’s computer” somewhat diminishes the full materiality of the internet. What we call “the cloud” comprises <em>a lot</em> of computers and servers, linked by routers, switches, and overland or undersea cables: the <em>net work</em> of the world wide web. As of 2017, Google alone operated 15 data centers around the world, with many other smaller “cloud centers” and “caching sites” supplementing their operations. The largest of these facilities approach 1 million square feet, while reports about a new Google data center in the Netherlands claimed, “the company…contracted for the entire 62 Megawatt output of a nearby windfarm and ran 9,941 miles of computer cable within the facility.”<sup id="fnref:datacenterknowledge2017" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:datacenterknowledge2017" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> The infrastructure for other major tech companies, such as Facebook or Amazon, is just as expansive, while a host of others employ smaller—but still extensive—server farms and data centers. While they exude, perhaps, an aura of corporate sterility off-putting to many scholars of material culture, such data centers comprise the backbone of digital culture and, though often unseen by users, leave enormous economic, environmental, and material footprints in the world.</p> <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/CERN_Server_03.jpg" alt="A server room at CERN" style="width:800px"/></p> <p><em>Caption: A server room at CERN; Creative Commons image <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CERN_Server_03.jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></em></p> <p>We are faced with a strange and hazardous irony in the digital age: surrounded by a rapidly-proliferating domain of objects, increasingly central to our social, economic, and political lives, we fall back on a strange dichotomy of “digital” versus “analog,” eliding a the much more complex and interesting ways these two modes entwine and interact. Popular attitudes toward the digital vary widely and are often highly contradictory. Digital content is both unreliably ephemeral and stubbornly eternal; hyperlinks go dead rapidly, and thus cannot suffice as scholarly references, while embarrassing photos posted to social media in high school will surely derail presidential campaigns decades hence. Such contradictions arise in part due to the novel materiality of digital media, which is both widely distributed (i.e. pervasive) and rapidly iterative (i.e. impermanent). For scholars of material culture, the digital represents the fastest-growing domain of material culture in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, both in terms of its literal materials and its broader cultural effects. Understanding and theorizing the material culture of the digital is thus one of the field’s most pressing mandates.</p> <p>“Digital” was never truly a synonym for “virtual,” and each year the boundary between digital and analog materiality becomes more difficult to ascertain. 3D printing technologies manifest computational models in human spaces: everything from pop-culture tchotchkes to artificial human organs. Our digital network now connects a vast, growing, and uniquely vulnerable “internet of things” to the internet and to each other. The internet of things comprises the light bulbs, refrigerators, home security systems, thermostats, garage door openers, and other not-obviously computational devices we now can control from our devices, thus scattering the material culture of the digital across a wide swathe of twenty-first century culture writ large. Even more broadly, from our computers, tablets, and phones we summon people into action and spur a host of material objects into circulation. We click a button, for instance, and a worker begins hunting in an enormous factory for the item we have ordered, the first human being in a chain of humans who will close the commercial circuit. For scholars of material culture, then, the digital is essential to understand both as an assemblage of material objects and as a network that increasingly circumscribes the interactions of people and other material objects.</p> <h3 id="a-register-of-digital-materials">A Register of Digital Materials</h3> <p>To begin grappling with the materiality of the digital, we might compile a brief and necessarily incomplete inventory of computational artifacts:</p> <ul> <li>computer cases (desktop, laptop)</li> <li>monitors (CRT, LCD, OLED)</li> <li>CDs (CD-DA, CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, VCD, SVCD), DVDs (DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM)</li> <li>CD and DVD drives (internal, external)</li> <li>mice (ball, roller, optical, laser, trackpad, 3D, ergonomic)</li> <li>sever</li> <li>network router closets</li> <li>circuits</li> <li>motherboards</li> <li>sound cards</li> <li>graphics cards</li> <li>RAM chips</li> <li>cables (SCSI, PS/2, 3.5mm, VGA, DVI, USB [many varieties], Firewire, Lightning, Ethernet, HDMI)</li> <li>hard disk drives (internal, external)</li> <li>flash drives</li> <li>solid-state hard drives</li> <li>punch cards</li> <li>floppy drives</li> <li>floppy disks (8”, 5¼”, 3½”)</li> <li>Zip Drives and disks</li> <li>Jazz Drives and disks</li> <li>keyboards (standard, laptop, flexible, portable, optical, mechanical, illuminated)</li> <li>printers (dot matrix, thermal, ink jet, laser, desktop, drum, line)</li> <li>laptop or monitor stands</li> <li>software packaging</li> <li>tablets</li> <li>mobile phones</li> <li>communications satellites</li> <li>chargers (corded, wireless, portable, bicycle dynamos)</li> <li>cell phone charging lockers (in airports and public spaces)</li> <li>external power supplies, speakers (internal, external, portable, smart)</li> <li>headphones</li> <li>smart appliances (light bulbs, refrigerators, coffee makers, stoves, garage doors)</li> <li>gaming consoles</li> <li>controllers (game pads, joysticks, remotes)</li> <li>watches (digital, smart)</li> <li>fitness trackers</li> <li>scales (digital, smart)</li> <li>televisions</li> <li>virtual reality glasses</li> <li>3D printers</li> <li>laser cutters</li> </ul> <p>I expect anyone who reads the list above will think of at least one artifact it misses. It largely cannot cover the vast array of objects now produced with embedded computer components: everything from automobiles to medical equipment to children’s toys to voting machines.</p> <p>Our material culture is suffused in digital objects and even more, in another strata of objects designed for carrying, storing, protecting, decorating, or displaying digital-material artifacts: e.g. laptop sleeves, mobile phone cases, or computer decal stickers. Moreover, the design of many objects designed primarily for non-computational purposes have been nonetheless altered for the internet age. It would be nearly unthinkable to imagine a modern briefcase, for instance, that does not include a separate, padded compartment for a laptop computer or, increasingly, a car without a USB charging port in its front cabin. Fields such as design and fashion have been radically reoriented around the digital—and radically reorganized in practice around digital platforms—so that any account of their material culture must engage the effects of computation. Discussions of twenty-first century architecture, for example, likely must account for AutoCAD and similar programs, just as discussions of clothing design likely must include accounts of Adobe Illustrator or its kin. Around this amorphous construction of “the digital,” then, we find a penumbra of artifacts that exist because of software or hardware, or that manifest the affordances and limitations of software.</p> <h3 id="perceiving-digital-materiality">Perceiving Digital Materiality</h3> <p>The word “network” has become increasingly metaphorical, describing relationships among devices but also among people, but it was coined because connected systems—whether of wire, rails, roads, or other conveyance for information or people—we thought to resemble the connected ropes of a net, or the “net work.” It was, perhaps, easier to remember the material entanglements of computing when users were required to physically connect their computers to hard-wired networks using telephone and then ethernet cables, establishing a literal and visual link that could pull or even tear, severing one device from the collective. Increasingly, people connect to the internet’s network of servers wirelessly, but still through material devices such as laptops, tablets, and mobile phones that communicate with yet other devices such as wifi transmitters or cell phone towers. As our computers have disconnected from wires, the number of computer-centered or computer-driven devices in our daily lives have increased exponentially. The US Environmental Protection Agency reports that “the <em>average</em> American household uses about 28 electronic products such as personal computers, mobile phones, televisions and electronic readers (e-readers);” a good many of these products are, especially if produced in the past decade, in some sense “digital” (My emphasis).<sup id="fnref:usepa2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:usepa2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> In becoming more portable, the digital has become for many essential to the minutia of both public and private life, even to bodily autonomy. Our mobile phones have become extensions of our memory and our digits. We are cyborgs in habit, if we are not (yet) corporally entangled with our devices.</p> <p>Some of the specific sensations facilitated by digital objects are likely novel; how many people in previous generations ran their fingers along perfectly smoothed glass as regularly as a twenty-first-century smartphone user? Nonetheless, our digits manipulate matter when we interact with digital interfaces. Dennis Tenen describes the effects of our fingers on keyboards as initiating a long chain of material changes: “What originates from (1) the keyboard as the mechanical action of a switch becomes (2) an electric signal that (3) leaves electromagnetic marks in computer memory, which (4) morph into phrases of liquid crystal on-screen, leaving behind (5) letters that emanate outward as light.”<sup id="fnref:tenen2017" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tenen2017" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> Our interactions with the touch screens on phones or tablets seem to close this loop, encouraging the perception that our fingers interact directly with light-emanated letters. In reality, however, our fingers brush capacitive touch screens that send small electrical charges into our fingertips, completing circuits and sending signals to our devices about where their screens were contacted.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the materiality of computation seems to become increasingly difficult to apprehend even as computation increasingly suffuses culture. The room-filling computers of the 1940s and 50s were literally and metaphorically hefty. The cumulative mass of twenty-first century computation would outweigh these machines by many orders of magnitude, but its ubiquity and even its interfaces serve to mask this reality. The graphical user interfaces (GUIs) through which we typically interact with computers deliberately obscure the machinery that creates and sustains them. Interfaces are largely organized around skeuomorphic representations of older media: we work from a desktop, we delete files through a trash can, we save files by clicking a floppy disk, or we browse the internet through windows and tabs. These skeuomorphs help communicate functionality to users, to make new and unfamiliar operations tractable, but they also serve to separate the objects we interact with from their own materiality—the simulation on the screen encourages us to look past the screen itself, along with its attendant components, and imagine something like a disembodied cloud of software rather than a warehouse full of servers.</p> <p>Marlene Manoff outlines some of the dangers that follow when scholars misrecognize the digital space as immaterial. Writing primarily to librarians, she cautions them not to replace the term “collection management” with “content management,” because “When one calls collection management ‘content management,’ librarians are encouraged to think about content in the abstract, as if it existed apart from any particular physical embodiment…The term ‘content management,’” she continues, “suggests that we have somehow moved beyond mundane considerations of physical reality when, in fact, the electronic environment introduces a whole new set of questions about the material aspects of library collections.” One danger of making a mental shift from “collections” to “content,” Manoff argues, is that such a shift will encourage notions of surrogacy between digitized materials and their archival originals that can flatten the unique properties of either medium. As a result, “some librarians are rushing to identify funds that can be freed by canceling print subscriptions that are duplicated in electronic formats. Others are eager to jettison paper back-files in order to free up shelf space without much consideration of the reliability of the back-files or the digital archive.”<sup id="fnref:manoff2006" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:manoff2006" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> By failing to fully account for the digital medium’s specific materiality, in other words, we place the past and future at greater risk. In my own research I have suggested that the “myth of surrogacy” stunts our historical and contemporary imaginations alike, shrinking the materials of the past to the size of a computer screen and, perhaps paradoxically, encouraging us to use digitized materials as if they had no unique properties to their medium.<sup id="fnref:cordell2017a" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cordell2017a" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p> <h3 id="digital-environments">Digital Environments</h3> <p>As Jussi Parikka reminds us, we cannot separate the myriad objects of the digital world from the materials and systems underlying their construction, use, and eventual disposal: “Media and information technology are far from zero entropy mathematical dreams, and embedded in physical networks, afforded by hardware and hard<em>work</em> – practices of mining, shipping, polishing, constructing, and then the other way round, when disgorging such machines.” Parikka insists “the materiality of information technology starts from the soil, and underground” before listing the minerals necessary for the creation of many digital artifacts:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Cobalt</strong> Lithium-ion batteries, synthetic fuels<br/> <strong>Gallium</strong> Thin layer photovoltaics, IC, WLED<br/> <strong>Indium</strong> Displays, thin layer photovoltaics<br/> <strong>Tantalum</strong> Micro capacitors, medical technology<br/> <strong>Antimony</strong> ATO, micro capacitors<br/> <strong>Germanium</strong> Fibre optic cable, IR optical technologies<br/> <strong>Platinum</strong> (PGM) Fuel cells, catalysts<br/> <strong>Palladium</strong> (PGM) Catalysts, seawater desalination<br/> <strong>Niobium</strong> Micro capacitors, ferroalloys<br/> <strong>Neodymium</strong> Permanent magnets, laser technology<sup id="fnref:parikka2012" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:parikka2012" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>While it may seem obvious that computer hardware is material, common metaphors such as “the cloud” obscure the gritty realities of cobalt, tantalum, and niobium, and the human labor required to extract these materials from the ground. Creating, running, and maintaining our digital infrastructure takes a substantial environmental toll.</p> <p>Moreover, the energy costs of our ubiquitous devices are even more substantial, and only growing. Social scientists Richard Maxwell and Toby Miller note in their book <em>Greening the Media</em>,</p> <blockquote> <p>residential electricity consumption for powering ICT/CE [Information and Consumer Technology/Consumer Electronics] is also growing at unprecedented rates, accounting for about 15 percent of global residential electricity consumption by 2009. By 2011, upwards of ten billion devices needed external power supplies, including two billion TV sets, a billion personal computers, and cell phones, which reached five billion subscriptions in 2010, including 85 percent of the US public. In 2011, nearly three-quarters of the world’s population owned one, and threequarters of these accounts were held in the Global South. By 2009, about 40 percent of US homes had video-gaming consoles, which collectively consumed electricity at the same annual rate as San Diego, the ninth-largest city in the country. If media usage continues to grow at this rate, the IEA estimates that electricity consumption by electronic equipment will rise to 30 percent of global demand by 2022, and 45 percent by 2030.<sup id="fnref:maxwell2012" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:maxwell2012" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>These predictions have largely proven accurate, save minor improvements made through the development of more energy efficient devices in the years since 2012. However, new environmental wrinkles have also emerged during this same time period. For example, the networks of people and machines mining Bitcoin, a “cryptocurrency” that exists entirely in code, are estimated to consume as much electricity as countries such as Ireland or Austria.<sup id="fnref:vries2018" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vries2018" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> The process of verifying electronic transactions, which is required to produce new digital currency, is often referred to as “mining.” These processes are often automated for speed, scale, and efficiency, set running on computers and servers twenty-four hours a day. It might seem a strange skeuomorph to call these operations “mining,” but just as mining for natural resources requires large expenditures of human and machine energy and can damage the natural world, technologies for extracting digital resources require substantial investment of time and resources, and take an environmental toll.</p> <p>Our digital devices take a human toll as well. Mined minerals are shaped into computer components and devices in massive factories, many in the developing world, and often with poor records regarding employee health and happiness. Most prominently, in 2010 at least 18 workers attempted suicide at a complex of Foxconn factories in China, where, among other products, workers assembled Apple’s iPhone smartphones and iPad tablet computers. Accounts of conditions in these factories vary widely, but grim images of suicide nets, installed to prevent workers jumping off factory buildings to their deaths, circulated online and in broadcast media, soberly remind consumers of the human costs of building digital devices—though sales of Foxconn-made products has not seemed to slow as a result. Stories juxtaposing the hard labor of device assembly with the conveniences of digital access often deliberately recall the factory literature of the nineteenth-century and early twentieth centuries, which challenged readers to recognize the human costs of that age’s technical marvels. Frankly, this is not a reckoning well undertaken by either the general public or scholars: myself included, as I type this article on a device made by unknown workers under unknown conditions.</p> <p>Concerns about material and economic exploitation attend the entire digital lifecycle. While as a category digital devices are ubiquitous in the early twentieth century, <em>particular</em> digital devices have very short shelf lives: new software often will not run on models only a few years old, new features convince users to upgrade, or older devices simply become unfashionable. Many companies prioritize “planned obsolescence” in their design and marketing, in order to keep consumers buying. Because older digital devices remain physical objects, however, they must go somewhere when discarded. In the best cases, components or even whole devices can be recycled or “up cycled” toward new uses: an old laptop becomes an interface for a home entertainment system, perhaps, or components from an old phone are reused in a different device. But old electronics all too often become simply waste, and often dangerous waste. Developed countries often ship “e-waste” to developing countries, where it can be stripped for parts and chemical components more cheaply and often under much more hazardous conditions for workers.</p> <p>In other words, the digital or virtual environments we navigate on our screens are made of terrestrial stuff, and make lasting terrestrial changes. A stunning, comprehensive account of “the full stack”—another weighty, materialist phrase—of labor, technology, and economics required for humans to interact with a single digital device, the Amazon Echo, can be found in Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler’s essay and map, “Anatomy of an AI System: The Amazon Echo as an anatomical map of human labor, data and planetary resources.”<sup id="fnref:crawford2018" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:crawford2018" class="footnote" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> This remarkable piece begins noting,</p> <blockquote> <p>A brief command and a response is the most common form of engagement with this consumer voice-enabled AI device. But in this fleeting moment of interaction, a vast matrix of capacities is invoked: interlaced chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, prediction and optimization…each small moment of convenience—be it answering a question, turning on a light, or playing a song—requires a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and data.</p> </blockquote> <p>From here, Crawford and Joler outline those extractions, connecting work mining the lithium reserves of the Salar in southwest Bolivia; to Athanasius Kircher’s 1673 invention of “the <em>statua citofonica</em>, or the ‘talking statue;’” to “hardware manufacturing and assembly processes in Chinese factories” and “exploited outsourced cognitive workers in developing countries labelling AI training data sets;” to the Victorian destruction of the trees that produced <em>gutta percha</em> for insulating telegraphic and other cables; to the shipping boats full of cargo containers that “produce 3.1% of global yearly CO2 emissions” today.</p> <p>This summary unfortunately elides most of their essay’s points, but hopefully hints at the complexity of the material-social-technical systems they demonstrate as necessary for understanding a single computational device. Scholars of material culture could and should take on the responsibility of producing similar accounts of the many other devices and artifacts of the digital age. Doing so will require both the analytical capacities we typically associate with humanistic inquiry and the technical capacities that will enable scholars to understand interplays between hardware and software, devices and networks, or users and systems.</p> <h3 id="software-materials">Soft(ware) Materials</h3> <p>Even less apparent than the materiality of hardware is the materiality of the software running on it. We too often overlook the intimate connections among hardware and software, strangely failing to link—intellectually, at least—our ubiquitous devices to the programs that run on them. But software is also a <em>thing</em> with a physical presence in the world. In a 2014 lecture, Matthew Kirschenbaum looked at software from fourteen perspectives to outline all the ways in which it is a “thing”: “software as asset,” “software as shrinkwrap,” or “software as epigraphy,” to name just a few of the frames he draws around a category that for libraries, archives, and museums “remains a narrow, niche, or lesser priority” for preservation.<sup id="fnref:kirschenbaum2014" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kirschenbaum2014" class="footnote" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> Software exists in particular material states and on particular media. Software can be transmitted from device to device through wireless signals, but it must ultimately <em>be</em> somewhere, and be some<em>thing</em>.</p> <p>The field of digital forensics often relies on the material relationships among software and hardware, the inscriptions (and similar traces) made by software on its hardware. The field was developed and is typically employed to find digital evidence of crimes—shady bank transactions or incriminating emails—though its methods have been adapted by scholars for other purposes. In his 2008 book, <em>Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</em>, for example, Kirschenbaum excavates the material traces left on disks and hard drives to show how techniques adapted from book history and media archeology can locate the physical traces of digital texts. Beginning from the question, “In what…does the materiality of electronic texts consist?” Kirschenbaum argues that, like the letters inscribed on paper through print,</p> <blockquote> <p>Electronic textuality is similarly locatable, even though we are not accustomed to thinking of it in physical terms. Bits can be measured in microns when recorded on a magnetic hard disk. They can be visualized with technologies such as magnetic force microscopy (MFM), which is a variation on the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). When a CD-ROM is burned, a laser superheats a layer of dye to create pits and lands, tiny depressions on the grooved surface of the platter. The length of these depressions is measured in microns, their width and depth in nanometers.<sup id="fnref:kirschenbaum2008a" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kirschenbaum2008a" class="footnote" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Cold metal bites into rag paper to print a hand-press era book; electrons are stored in the cells of a solid state hard drive to save a Word file. As Kirschenbaum acknowledges, the materiality of something like a Word file is less immediately tangible to human senses, which makes it harder for scholars to apprehend.</p> <p>Nevertheless this scholars must develop new analytical capacity to close this intellectual distance. As Alan Galey notes in his bibliographic reading of Johanna Skibsrud’s <em>The Sentimentalists</em> in both print and digital editions, understanding such objects will “require a synthesis between forensic methods and the humanities’ interpretive strengths.” Such a synthesis is necessary, Galey argues in his conclusion, because,</p> <blockquote> <p>e-books, like all digital texts, require us to interpret phenomena not directly observable by the senses. We must rely on layers upon layers of digital tools and interfaces, as we have seen in the examples above. A purely empirical and forensic perspective assumes that objects speak for themselves, and yield up their evidence to the observation of human senses and the inquiry of human reason.<sup id="fnref:galey2012" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:galey2012" class="footnote" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The peculiar materiality of software cannot be entirely understood through direct observation, and will require researchers to develop new standards of evidence, as well as new methodologies for gathering it.</p> <p>Scholars of material culture studies must cultivate such proficiencies, as the future of storage promises to write digital data onto new, even less-apprehensible material substrates. In their ongoing efforts to find more efficient, capacious, and compact media, researchers have succeeded in saving “502 terabits per square inch” in a “flat two-dimensional lattice” of chlorine atoms and vacancies. These researchers tout the potential capacity of atomic memory, noting in conclusion that “Translating the two-dimensional storage density presented here to three dimensions, would…allow the storage of the entire US Library of Congress in a cube 100 μm /[micrometers, or millionths of a meter wide/].”<sup id="fnref:kalff2016" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kalff2016" class="footnote" rel="footnote">18</a></sup> Another area of current research marries computation and biology, using DNA as a data storage medium. One group of researchers, for example, “encoded computer files totalling 739 kilobytes of hard-disk storage and with an estimated Shannon information of 5.2 3 10<sup>6</sup> bits into a DNA code, synthesized this DNA, sequenced it and reconstructed the original files with 100% accuracy.” Currently DNA storage is too time- and resource-intensive for most archives, but researchers believe “if current trends continue,” then “DNA-based storage becomes practical for archives with a horizon of less than 50” years within a decade. In particular, researchers are looking to DNA as an archival medium,</p> <blockquote> <p>The DNA-based storage medium has different properties from traditional tape-or disk-based storage. As DNA is the basis of life on Earth, methods for manipulating, storing and reading it will remain the subject of continual technological innovation. As with any storage system, a large-scale DNA archive would need stable DNA management and physical indexing of depositions. But whereas current digital schemes for archiving require active and continuing maintenance and regular transferring between storage media, the DNA-based storage medium requires no active maintenance other than a cold, dry and dark environment (such as the Global Crop Diversity Trust’s Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which has no permanent on-site staff) yet remains viable for thousands of years even by conservative estimates.<sup id="fnref:goldman2013" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:goldman2013" class="footnote" rel="footnote">19</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>While these media may almost impossibly microscopic, that we can encode digital data onto atoms or into DNA strangely makes the intrinsic materiality of that data plainly apparent. Data can be digital, chemical, or even biological.</p> <h3 id="preserving-and-accessing-digital-culture">Preserving and Accessing Digital Culture</h3> <p>One of the most potent and sobering reminders of the digital’s materiality is its rapid dilapidation. Technologists and archivists both increasingly use the phrase “digital dark age” to refer to the early era of modern computing, which becomes less accessible each year as its hardware degrades and its software grows less compatible with new hardware. These processes are often called “bit rot” or “data rot”—an intriguingly biological metaphor for the decay of digital artifacts. Google Vice President Vint Cerf has been perhaps the highest profile voice worried that “even if we accumulate vast archives of digital content, we may not actually know what it is” very far into the future.<sup id="fnref:ghosh2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ghosh2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">20</a></sup> As a result of material decay and the obsolescence cycles of the computer industry, an entire generation of cultural heritage is in critical danger of being lost to history. These endangered artifacts include software objects themselves—programs, computer games, operating systems—and objects created with them, such as the correspondence or working documents of important social, political, or artistic figures.</p> <p>As it is written today, computer code operates at several removes from machine language. Programmers do not write in binary, they write in C++, Python, R, or any number of programming languages that are compiled or assembled, translated into machine code that the computer can execute directly. Machine code depends quite literally on particular hardware parameters; the set of available instructions differs for each processor, though newer processors may include instructions from their predecessors. When hardware evolves too far past the parameters for which a given piece of software was written, however, that program can no longer be translated and run as intended. Storage formats change even more rapidly, and many storage technologies physically degrade, in some cases at faster rates than pre-digital media, such as paper or vellum. As Roy Rosenzweig writes, “Print books and records decline slowly and unevenly—faded ink or a broken-off corner of a page. But digital records fail completely—a single damaged bit can render an entire document unreadable.” Even if data saved to a floppy disk is compatible with a modern program—and the floppy disk has not itself deteriorated—accessing that data would require access to a dwindling number of functional floppy disk drives, and an operating system capable of reading from the drive and disk. Rosenzweig asserts, “Well before most digital media degrade, they are likely to become unreadable because of changes in hardware (the disk or tape drives become obsolete) or software (the data are organized in a format destined for an application program that no longer works). The life expectancy of digital media may be as little as ten years, but very few hardware platforms or software programs last that long.”<sup id="fnref:rosenzweig2003" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rosenzweig2003" class="footnote" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> The challenges of preserving born-digital materials, then, comes not from the development of media, hardware, or software in isolation, but instead from simultaneous—but not necessarily <em>coordinated</em>—change across all three.</p> <p><em>Preserving Virtual Worlds</em> was a project that brought together researchers from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of Maryland, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Linden Lab to investigate the challenges of preserving video games and interactive fiction from the 1960s to early 2000s. In the project’s final report, they identify obsolescence as the first obstacle to their work:</p> <blockquote> <p>The most obvious problem affecting these materials is the obsolescence of the hardware and software infrastructures necessary to allow software to run. The earliest game in our case set, <em>Spacewar!</em>, currently exists in its original form stored on a punched paper tape intended to be read into the memory of a PDP-1 computer. There is, to the best of our knowledge, only one functioning PDP-1 computer left in the world, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, and paper tape readers are not exactly common equipment at this time. The fate of the paper tape of <em>Spacewar!</em> is the fate awaiting all games without the active intervention of preservationists. A book may pass 50 years on a shelf and still be readily accessible; rapid technological change and the resulting obsolescence of the technology necessary to access software mean that a computer game will not.</p> </blockquote> <p>Beyond this “most obvious” problem, however, the team noted the difficulty in bounding precisely what object must be preserved, because “While we tend to think of the game as a relatively discrete package of software, the reality is that a <em>functioning </em>game involves a web of interconnections between the game’s executable, an operating system, the hardware platform used to execute both, and potentially network hardware and software and a multiplicity of other computer systems.”<sup id="fnref:mcdonough2010a" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mcdonough2010a" class="footnote" rel="footnote">22</a></sup></p> <p>Scholars and archivists alike wrestle with different ideas about how best to preserve and present histories of hardware and software, and it is likely that some combination of these ideas will be required as the urgency and scope of the problem increase. One of the primary methods for born-digital preservation requires the maintenance of original hardware, on which researchers can access pertinent software, while the other relies on the emulation of older software environments on newer hardware. The Emory University Libraries, for instance, rely on emulation to present the digital “papers” of writer Salman Rushdie. Emory Libraries’ help sheet for this collection offers insight into the preservation challenges that digital technologies raise for libraries, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions:</p> <blockquote> <p>Welcome to the Salman Rushdie digital archive. On this workstation, you will find selected digital files from Rushdie’s Macintosh Performa 5400, one of several computers and other related devices that form the born digital component of the Salman Rushdie papers in Emory University’s Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library (MARBL).</p> <p>The majority of the digital files date from 1992-2002, and consists of notes and drafts of Rushdie’s writings and selected correspondence. Of particular interest is a small cache of email correspondence, representing Rushdie’s first foray into this emerging form of communication in the late 1990s. Writings include drafts of Rushdie’s fiction, such as <em>East, West</em> (1994), <em>The Moor’s Last Sigh</em> (1995), and <em>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</em> (1999). Nonfiction writings include notes and drafts for <em>Step Across this Line</em>, Rushdie’s collection of essays and criticism, published in 2002. Other writings include drafts of the <em>Midnight’s Children</em> and <em>The Courter</em> play scripts, as well as drafts of letters to the editor, newspaper columns, poems, and speeches. The Performa 5400 contains a backup of an earlier computer, which Rushdie entitled “OLD MAC,” and a laptop, the “Powerbook,” which Rushdie likely used in tandem with the Performa 5400.</p> </blockquote> <p>Emory Libraries does allow researchers to access these materials through a searchable database, but also through an emulation of Rushdie’s Macintosh Performa 5400. “In this environment,” the library’s help sheet reports, “you will be able to view Rushdie’s exact directory structure and open each file in the application in which it was created, such as MacWrite Pro or ClarisWorks.”<sup id="fnref:emorylibrariesmanuscriptarchivesandrarebooksarchive" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:emorylibrariesmanuscriptarchivesandrarebooksarchive" class="footnote" rel="footnote">23</a></sup> These two projects evidence ideas of emulation that are becoming increasingly important for thinking historically about digital artifacts and culture.</p> <p>By contrast, other scholars seek to preserve historical computing objects in working order for future study. Founded in 2009, the Media Archeology Lab (MAL) at the University of Colorado at Boulder, describes itself as “a place for cross-disciplinary experimental research and teaching using still functioning media from the past.” Contrasting its mission to media labs focused on the latest technologies, the MAL claims to be “propelled equally by the need to both preserve and maintain access to historically important media of all kinds—from magic lanterns, projectors, and typewriters to personal computers from the 1970s through the 1990s, as well as early works of digital literature/art which were created on the hardware/software housed in the lab.”<sup id="fnref:mediaarchaeologylab2018" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mediaarchaeologylab2018" class="footnote" rel="footnote">24</a></sup> In spaces like the MAL, students or scholars can play the 1987 adventure game <em>King’s Quest III: To Heir is Human</em> on an Amiga computer or experience writing in <em>WordPerfect</em> on an Apple IIe. Such resources are an enormous boon to those concerned with the social and material histories of the digital age, but are also an enormous undertaking to create and, especially, maintain as parts and expertise in older computers alike disappear. Whether through emulation or preservation, it has become increasingly clear that the early history of computing—a phase, I would argue, that continues to this day—will require substantially more engagement from scholars if we hope to preserve its texts and artifacts for future students, scholars, or the public.</p> <h3 id="digital-material-circuits">Digital-Material Circuits</h3> <p>While the digital realm certainly is material, its materiality is in many ways distinct from those objects we identify as “analog.” The objects we encounter on a screen often mimic a physical form quite distinct from the form they actually inhabit. As Kirschenbaum argues, “a digital environment is an abstract projection supported and sustained by its capacity to propagate the illusion (or call it a working model) of <em>immaterial</em> behavior: identification without ambiguity, transmission without loss, repetition without originality.”<sup id="fnref:kirschenbaum2008a2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kirschenbaum2008a2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">25</a></sup> It is the domain of images displayed by computer screens that we mark as “virtual reality”; these are models of the real or fantasy worlds. Increasingly, however, the digital and analog worlds bleed into each other. When the mobile game <em>Pokémon Go</em> was released in July 2016, it sent players scrambling around their towns and cities in search of the cartoon creatures, which, though an “augmented reality” application, could be found on real streets, in real buildings, and even, sometimes problematically, at real historical sites and monuments. In 2016, for instance, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. requested that <em>Pokémon Go</em> players stop catching the cartoon creatures in the memorial space. The game’s developers automated the creation of “Pokestops” to coincide with landmarks as identified on digital mapping platforms, but without considering that some landmarks might be inappropriate locations for such play.</p> <p>While this implementation of augmented reality was rightfully decried—and soon corrected—there are arguments in favor of interfaces that blend digital and analog environments. Even <em>Pokémon Go</em> was praised for urging players toward fresh air and exercise, and some scholars and cultural heritage institutions have turned to augmented reality to engage the public. The Museum of London launched the app <em>Streetmuseum</em> in 2010 (currently unavailable). The <em>Histories of the National Mall</em> website, developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, allows visitors to this Washington, D.C. spot to explore historical maps, photos, stories, and other materials related to the National Mall as they explore the physical space itself.<sup id="fnref:royrosenzweigcenterforhistoryandnewmedia2018" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:royrosenzweigcenterforhistoryandnewmedia2018" class="footnote" rel="footnote">26</a></sup> The Smithsonian’s Museum of Natural History’s <em>Skin and Bones</em> app attempts to breathe new life into one of its oldest exhibit halls, allowing visitors to overlay muscles, skin, and other anatomical features onto the skeletons in the exhibit hall, and even breathe virtual life into the creatures on display.<sup id="fnref:smithsoniannationalmuseumofnaturalhistory" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:smithsoniannationalmuseumofnaturalhistory" class="footnote" rel="footnote">27</a></sup> These applications bring virtual reality into explicit dialogue with the “real world,” layering the digital and analog.</p> <p>In the past decade or so, the digital world has manifest in the analog in another significant way, through the growth of technologies such as 3D printing that express computer models in materials such as plastic, resin, ceramic, metal, and even tissue. The practical and theoretical applications of 3D printing are expanding rapidly, and the technology can be found everywhere form engineering firms, to hospitals, to libraries. The broadest application of 3D printing has been for creating physical models relatively quickly and cheaply, allowing engineers (or other researchers) to create a digital schematic of a design and then generate a physical representation of it relatively quickly and affordably. These models can be used to test structural properties of designs before production, compare different design options, or simply to demonstrate for clients.</p> <p>As with augmented reality, museums and other cultural heritage institutions experiment with 3D printing as a way to bring students, researchers, and the general public into contact with artifacts they might not otherwise be able to interact with. New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art was one of the first museums to begin making 3D models of its artifacts available for download and reproduction, as have national museums such as the Smithsonian<sup id="fnref:smithsonianinstitution" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:smithsonianinstitution" class="footnote" rel="footnote">28</a></sup> and British Museum, alongside a host of smaller institutions and individual research projects. The University of North Texas’ <em>3Dhotbed</em> is “a collaborative project that seeks to enhance book history instruction by providing access to affordable teaching tools and related materials for pedagogical purposes.”<sup id="fnref:jacobs2018" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:jacobs2018" class="footnote" rel="footnote">29</a></sup>. The project has created 3D models of hard-to-find artifacts from the hand-press era that teachers of book history, bibliography, and related disciplines can use to demonstrate objects’ use to students. The project’s current models include a two-part type mould and matrix used to demonstrate to students how individual pieces of moveable type were created, a facsimile of a Renaissance-era woodcut image, and a facsimile of a Chinese xylographic woodblock. These are materials not likely to be available for most classroom instructors, made accessible through 3D models and printing.</p> <p>As the possibilities expand for material substrates used in 3D printing, so to have its applications. Practically, 3D printers can be used to create hard-to-find replacement parts for rare or outdated machines. Though there are relatively few replacement parts that justify the time and cost of creating a 3D model and printing it, but groups such as NASA are experimenting with ways the technology might assist with repairs on highly customized tools in out of the way places, such as outer space.<sup id="fnref:hall2016" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hall2016" class="footnote" rel="footnote">30</a></sup> Experiments also continue in 3D printing another kind of rare “spare part,” as biologists and doctors work toward 3D printing viable human organs for use in transplants. While it might sound like science fiction, this technology has produced near-viable organs. A 2014 review article in <em>Nature</em> describes the major approaches to “3D bioprinting,” including biomimicry, autonomous self-assembly, and mini-tissues, as well as overviewing the primary technological approaches to this challenge. In this instance, the material culture of the digital becomes the biological culture of the digital, a new corporal entanglement between computers and ourselves.<sup id="fnref:murphy2014" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:murphy2014" class="footnote" rel="footnote">31</a></sup></p> <p>In addition, the past decade has seen a growing body of research and practice around ideas of “data physicalization” or “haptic data,” both movements that seek to challenge the domination of sight in expressions or analysis of data, and both movements that bring computerized data viscerally into the material world. In contrast to data visualization, “A <em>data physicalization</em> (or simply physicalization) is a physical artifact whose geometry or material properties encode data.” This paper goes on to imagine a museum exhibit in which visitors pick up stones of various temperatures to experience changes in Earth’s climate over time, as well as describing existing data physicalization, such as “a wooden three-dimensional model of Mexico City where height encodes population density.”<sup id="fnref:jansen2015" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:jansen2015" class="footnote" rel="footnote">32</a></sup>. Such physicalizations blend data science with the art installation, and close the circuit of data collected from physical or built environments, aggregated and analyzed computationally, and then expressed—transformed—in material form.</p> <p>These kinds of experiments bring information out of screens and into human spaces, often putting people into literal contact with data representations. Haptic data experiments do not simply encode data through material properties, but invite people to experience data using senses beyond (though perhaps including) sight. The <em>Vibrant Lives</em> project, for instance, describes an approach that “look[s] to somatic and contemporary dance practices for new design strategies that engage users in affective, felt relationships with personal technologies and personal data.”<sup id="fnref:rajko2016" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rajko2016" class="footnote" rel="footnote">33</a></sup> In installations sponsored by this project, participants experience the data streaming from their mobile phones as vibrations felt through devices worn on their clothing, or they both heard and felt the history of forced eugenic sterilization in California. In a blog post about the latter event, Jacqueline Wernimont describes participants “leaning in to feel a history of sterilization.” She notes that “The haptics are being shared with a thin, red metal wire that the participants have to touch lightly in order to not dampen the signal for others,” which is part of the <em>Vibrant Lives</em> team’s “effort to bring care for the experiences of others into the performance”<sup id="fnref:wernimont2016" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wernimont2016" class="footnote" rel="footnote">34</a></sup></p> <p>None of the above manifestations of the digital within the material quite touch an even broader set of ideas and practices gathered under the heading of “wearable technology.” These include the kinds of commercial trackers (e.g. the Fitbit) critiqued by projects such as <em>Vibrant Lives</em>, but also a range of experimental interfaces born from maker culture, most excitingly in dialogue with feminist or other ethical frameworks. Kim Brillante Knight surveys a range of feminist interventions in wearable technology, including this description of Kathleen McDermott’s work:</p> <blockquote> <p>Kathleen McDermott’s Urban Armor collection is a series of wearable garments in which we glimpse the cyborg’s radical possibility. Of particular note is the “Personal Space Dress”; its skirt expands when activated by a proximity sensor in order to protect the wearer from unwanted contact (Taylor 2014). The choice of a feminine garment—a dress—calls attention to the way women in particular are subject to harassment in public spaces.</p> </blockquote> <p>Knight describes her own research project <em>Fashioning Circuits</em>, which works in undergraduate classrooms “to articulate a counterpublic to dominant computing publics by creating a space in which women and underrepresented people of color feel comfortable learning and have the freedom to pursue projects that reflect their priorities and needs.”<sup id="fnref:knight2018" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:knight2018" class="footnote" rel="footnote">35</a></sup> They do this through a range of theoretical readings and discussions alongside making their own wearable technology that works against the dominant models of commercial devices.</p> <p>The kinds of pedagogical, research, and artistic experiments described in this section certainly create new material artifacts for description and study by scholars. In such work we identify another way in which the abstruse digital realm is brought into meaningful, physical contact with people. For scholars of material culture, physicalizations, haptic data, and wearable technology are doubly resonant, as both objects of potential study and as modeling potential modes of analysis or engagement. As in the catalog of digital devices, this section cannot fully document the many ways in which the digital reemergences into the analog world. With several decades of digitization past, we are now coming full circuit, and such manifestations of the digital are only due to increase.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>In <em>Writing Machines</em>, Hayles argues that the need for “media-specific analysis” became more important, rather than less, upon the introduction of the computer:</p> <blockquote> <p>As the vibrant new field of electronic textuality flexes its muscle, it is becoming overwhelmingly clear that we can no longer afford to ignore the material basis of literary production. Materiality of the artifact can no longer be positioned as a subspecialty within literary studies; it must be central, for without it we have little hope of forging a robust and nuanced account of how literature is changing under the impact of information technologies.<sup id="fnref:hayles20022" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hayles20022" class="footnote" rel="footnote">36</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>For Hayles, this moment of transition or remediation makes media apparent where it was once functionally transparent. The digital makes clear the unique material properties of the media that came before, though—as this essay has discussed–the new medium can be difficult to perceive so clearly. Scholars of material culture must conscienciously address this self-effacing property of new media: to recognize that it mediates no more or less than its predecessors, and to attend deliberately to its affordances and limitations.</p> <p>There is no cloud. What does exist is a vast plethora of digital devices, and a rapidly growing ecosystem of materials related to the creation, use, and maintenance of those devices. It would be a mistake to conflate digital culture with twenty-first century writ large, but it would be equally misguided to cordon digital studies from other forms of cultural analysis: material culture studies perhaps most of all. Hardware, software, and even data have material properties that warrant investigation and robust theorization.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:metz2012" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Cade Metz, “Google Reincarnates Dead Paper Mill as Data Center of Future” <em>Wired</em> (26 January 2012). <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/01/google-finland/">https://www.wired.com/2012/01/google-finland/</a>. <a href="#fnref:metz2012" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:liu2008b" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Alan Liu, “Imagining the New Media Encounter,” in Ray Siemens and Susan Schriebman, editors, <em>Companion to Digital Literary Studies</em>.

Writing several years ago in <a href="https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/31326090-9c70-4c0a-b2b7-74361582977e">“How Not to Teach Digital Humanities”</a>, I argued that DH practitioners should seek to “create versions of DH that make sense not at some ideal, universal level but at specific schools, in specific curricula, and with specific institutional partners.” I believed this when I was working in an English Department, and I continue to believe this now that I have moved to a School of Information Science. As such, it is incumbent on me to reconsider the frameworks of my teaching in light of new students with distinct skills, goals, and needs.</p> <p>For English and History students, working directly with historical media offers insights about their primary texts, and can help them develop research questions to consider features of material culture, whether toward analyses of literature or social, political, or cultural discourses. The same will certainly be true for some iSchool Ph.D. students planning cultural analytics dissertations, while for many students in the iSchool’s MLIS program, the class’ archival visits, historical media labs, and digital humanities training have clear applications to the curatorial, archival, or pedagogical roles they might take up in libraries, archives, and other cultural heritage institutions. But why might a student studying data science, cultural analytics, or computation—or, frankly, training for some of the less archives-oriented roles in libraries—engage with media we might describe as “old-fashioned” or even “obsolete?” I have written before about the relationships, historical and theoretical, <a href="https://ryancordell.org/research/programmabletype/">between letterpress printing and computer programming</a>, and at some gut level it seems true that a historical understanding of technology would benefit professionals extensively using and building modern technologies. But the fact that practices such as typesetting and programming “share essential features of deliberation, planning, execution, industry, and automation” does not in itself argue that information scientists—or even digital humanists—should learn to compose movable type.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thinking about “dependencies” as a framework for information &amp; data science students studying book/media history—e.g. in this class <a href="https://t.co/0YZ0T24cG4">https://t.co/0YZ0T24cG4</a>— technical dependencies, yes, but also modern computing’s social, political, &amp; aesthetic dependencies on historical media</p>&mdash; Ryan Cordell (@ryancordell) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryancordell/status/1468608329844936710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>In this post I propose that a framework of cultural “dependencies” can help articulate the value of historical media studies to contemporary information praxis more broadly. Cultivating both practical and theoretical understanding of legacy technologies offers information scientists crucial perspective on the technical and social commitments, possibilities, and limitations of contemporary data design, human-computer interaction (HCI), computer vision, and machine learning, as well as a critical orientation toward the labor and infrastructure undergirding contemporary media technologies. Much as scholars such as N. Katherine Hayles have argued “digital media have given us an opportunity we have not had for the last several hundred years: the chance to see print with new eyes” (<em>Writing Machines</em> pg. 33), converse attention to historical media make visible and salient questions of infrastructure and labor that can be obscured by ubiquitous field practices and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z">twenty-first century interfaces</a> alike. To put this idea another way: to design and implement computational systems that serve human beings, we need to learn from the informational systems that have evolved over much longer periods of time to meet both human needs and desires.</p> <p>To begin unpacking that idea, I recall a post by Ted Underwood—now my iSchool colleague—proposing that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)">the movie <em>Memento</em></a>, in which the character has to reconstruct his memory and current situation from clues he left in his environment and on his own body, offers an argument for studying the past:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If I were propagandizing for the humanities, I&#39;d show Memento. Then I&#39;d say: &quot;H. sapiens are like this character: our whole lives are defined by instructions handed down from the past. We don&#39;t necessarily know how those instructions got written. Are you curious?&quot;</p>&mdash; Ted Underwood (@Ted_Underwood) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ted_Underwood/status/1034157019262009346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>One important aspect of “our whole lives” is, of course, our media technologies: our computers, our phones, the ubiquitous devices scattered throughout our homes and offices. Despite the presentism of much technological discourse, our technologies are thoroughly “defined by instructions handed down from the past” that influence their shapes, their functionalities, their capacities, their limitations, and their communities of use. In 2021, we type on keyboards laid out to meet the mechanical needs of typewriters and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/fact-of-fiction-the-legend-of-the-qwerty-keyboard-49863249/">influenced by the feedback of telegraph operators</a>, who “found the alphabetical arrangement to be confusing and inefficient for translating morse code.” While more efficient keyboard layouts have been developed and proselytized in the intervening century, a combination of infrastructure, training, and habit has kept QWERTY as the dominant arrangement for the most central input device, perhaps, of modern life. Even modern touchscreens, in which the keyboard is not a device but an arrangement of pixels, arrange those pixels following the guidance of nineteenth-century telegraph operators. We text between mobile phones and post on Twitter using one nineteenth-century technology while the character limit of those tweets—even now that it has been doubled—<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3060165/a-brief-history-of-twitters-140-character-limit">stems directly from the informational limits of early mobile texting technology</a>.</p> <p>Twenty-first century computing is replete with such historical references, both in its hardware and software. Some of these references are metaphorical, such as the “files” and “folders” we navigate and manipulate in both graphical and textual operating systems. Some are aesthetic, such as the typography we use for both online and analog communication, much of which comes directly or is adapted from letterpress typography. Finally, some are material, such as the layout of keyboards referenced above, or the shapes of e-readers and even mobile phones, which correspond—perhaps inadvertently in the latter case—to common shapes and formats of historical media. Some of these elements can be identified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphs</a>, particularly the graphical elements of computer interfaces that emulate the visual characteristics of previous media. Designers endlessly the debate <a href="https://medium.com/design-warp/skeuomorphism-design-we-learned-to-outgrow-8a24895a80d0">the value of skeuomorphic design</a>, which waxes and wanes in popularity, with some arguing that skeuomorphs help users understand the use and value of new media, while others argue that skeuomorphs hold new media back, preventing designers and programmers from taking full advantages of new capabilities.</p> <p>In the most strident calls to abandon historical reference points and fully exploit the affordances of current media—or better, what <a href="http://www.deadmedia.org/modest-proposal.html">Bruce Sterling called “infant media”</a>—I would identify a selective presentism, founded on a partial timeline that only records the most visibly successful transformations in technological history. By contrast, Sterling’s proposed <em>Handbook of Dead Media</em> sought to document</p> <blockquote> <p>the failures of media, the collapses of media, the supercessions of media, the strangulations of media…all the freakish and hideous media mistakes that we should know enough now not to repeat…media that have died on the barbed wire of technological advance, media that didn’t make it, martyred media, dead media.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href="http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index-cat.html">working notes of that project</a> remain an invaluable reminder that our genealogies of media technology ignore the vast majority of its evolutionary branches, thus making contemporary successes seem inevitable, while contemporary failures seem all the more unaccountable.</p> <p>In <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000264/000264.html">her analysis of the ways contemporary technological discourse invokes the printing press as a historical metaphor</a>, Elyse Graham argues,</p> <blockquote> <p>the printing press is a ubiquitous analogy for the computer in part because it readily summons narratives of seismic innovation. Even the language of “obsolete” technology and “new” media reaffirms these buried metaphors on a smaller scale…the popularity of these metaphors may best be attributed to marketplace pressures in Silicon Valley and the academic marketplace of ideas.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a metaphor, rather than an embodied machine, The Printing Press™ becomes a sudden and singular “revolutionary technology” rather than the assemblage of diverse technologies, practices, and social structures that shifted over time within a constellation of other technologies and media. The metaphorical Printing Press™ has no dependencies, and conveys no dependencies on the contemporary technologies it is invoked to advocate.</p> <p>Referencing only particular historical technologies as moments of sudden rupture obscures the interdependence and overlap of media technologies from the past through the present. Even the debate over skeuomorphism focuses only on the most visible connections between old and new media, when in reality media imbricate across visible and invisible registers. <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-3-1">Alan Liu famously argued</a> that narratives of new media “‘conversion’ connote…too right-angled a change” when a “better term is indeed ‘encounter,’ indicating a thick, unpredictable zone of contact—more borderland than border line—where (mis)understandings of new media are negotiated along twisting, partial, and contradictory vectors.” Consider the seemingly endless debate over electronic books. For more than a decade, we have seen no end of pieces <a href="https://www.bookbusinessmag.com/post/ebooks-will-eventually-replace-print/">claiming that e-books will replace print</a>, <a href="https://observer.com/2018/11/ebook-sales-decline-independent-bookstores/">declaring e-books dead when print sales rebound</a>, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/stagnant-and-dull-can-digital-books-ever-replace-print">mourning the lost potential of e-books</a>, or <a href="https://www.appletoncreative.com/blog/three-reasons-why-printed-books-will-never-die/">defending the intrinsic value of print</a>. As I write, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22687960/book-shortage-paper-ink-printing-labor-explained">a paper shortage imperils print book production</a> even as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2021/09/why-are-ebooks-so-terrible/620068/">many lose patience with ebooks entirely</a>.</p> <p>Just seach <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=will+ebooks+replace+print">“will ebooks replace print”</a> to see a vast range of opinions on a question that entirely misses the reality Liu and other scholars identify, which is the “thick, unpredictable zone of contact” between these two media. Ebooks have shifted our ecologies of reading, but have not supplanted printed books, and do not seem poised to in such a totalizing way. Instead, both print and electronic books now meet distinct readerly needs, desires, and preferences. Moreover, as scholars such as <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhqdev/vol/7/1/000150/000150.html">Whitney Trettien</a> and <a href="https://post45.org/2020/04/bibliologistics-the-nature-of-books-now-or-a-memorable-fancy/">Matthew Kirschenbaum</a> remind us, in the era of print-on-demand, the line between electronic and printed books is not so easy to discern, while others, such as <a href="https://post45.org/2020/04/the-many-books-of-the-future-print-digital-literatures/">Élika Ortega</a>, highlight new works that bind modalities together. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/30227956">Writing about electronic texts and libraries in 2006, Jerome McGann argued</a> “We aren’t even close to developing browser interfaces to compare with the interfaces that have evolved in the past 500 years of print technology. A sophisticated, flexible, and stable system of graphical design and bibliographical codes stands ready for the scholar wishing to build a critical machine for the complex analysis of textual works.” I invoke this quote not to disparage current experiments with electronic interfaces, but to emphasize what a historically-informed praxis might offer information scientists, which is a deep well of knowledge about how people apprehend, respond to, and appreciate material presented through existing media technologies.</p> <p>It might seem a tangent, but consider the movie <em>Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse</em>, which cites, through largely computer-generated art, characteristics of off-set and risographic printing processes, such as mis-registration errors. As explained on <a href="https://www.imageworks.com/our-craft/feature-animation/movies/spider-man-spider-verse">Sony Pictures Imageworks’ website</a>, “One alternative type of camera lens focus (or DOF) was inspired by the comic book offset printing process where the (often accidental) mis-registering of the color passes can make an image look out of focus.” Mis-registration, an outcome of earlier information technologies and a mistake, at least originally, is now core to the visual rhetoric of comics, a kind of aesthetic dependency. We might call the art style of <em>Into the Spiderverse</em> skeuomorphic, but that seems too dismissive of a reference that is more deliberate, evocative, and beautiful. In an animated comic-book movie, those risographic elements ground the new cultural production in the history of its medium, providing a stable visual reference point that facilitates the other forms of visual experimentation also happening in the film. To oversimplify a bit, those registration errors have become part of what viewers like about comic art, and they cannot be “corrected” without sacrificing those attachments.</p> <p>To return to my opening claim, we might instead acknowledge that new media technologies are shot through with social, political, and aesthetic dependencies on historical media technologies. In software development, <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3344149">as Russ Cox describes</a> “a <em>dependency</em> is additional code that a programmer wants to call. Adding a dependency avoids repeating work already done: designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining a specific unit of code.” When writing software, programmers use existing “packages,” “libraries,” and “modules”—skeuomorphic terms, all—to make use of existing functions, support existing hardware and software, or otherwise extend their code without unnecessary work: “For a program that needs the functionality provided by one of these packages, the tedious work of manually downloading, installing, and updating the package is easier than the work of redeveloping that functionality from scratch.” Dependencies are necessary for much modern software development, though when adopted without sufficent care programmers can find themselves in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>.</p> <p>Media dependencies provide a useful framework for thinking about the ways that historical media technologies weave through contemporary media technologies, by turns benefiting and limiting the latter. We might wonder, for example, why people spent so much money in the first decades of digitization designing page-flip animations for online and electronic texts or we might mock, as <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/electric-cars-are-weirdly-skeuomorphic-421bf6c03f0f#f1d3-15a325458599-reply">Clive Thompson did recently</a> the “hilariously retro skeuomorphs” of Apple’s iOS and OS X applications. Thompson argues a strong position against skeuomorphic design, insisting that “skeuomorphs also wind up <em>hobbling</em> the new invention. Because skeuomorphs are based on the physical limits of an old-fashioned device, they get in the way of a designer taking full advantage of the new realm.” If “old-fashioned” media ideas interfere with innovation, why teach them to burgeoning information scientists at all?</p> <p>I would suggest that considering media dependencies helps us apprehend skeuomorphs along a continuum of other historical entanglements among new and old media. In some ways, what we eventually identify as “skeuomorphic” are the media elements that fall away—I’ve heard few arguments to stop calling computer files “files,” for example, or to ditch Garamond entirely in favor of a fully digital typefaces—but the long history of media change indicates that humans are quite bad at knowing, at the outset of a new medium, how it will be used, by whom, and to what ends. Media dependencies bridge old and new media, helping users across the span reckon with both sides. If McGann is right, as I suspect he is, that it will take time to develop electronic interfaces that function as well as analog interfaces developed over hundreds of years—and if we acknowledge that the history of media change comprises mostly failed experiments, dead ends, and short-lived fads—then we should not expect to know at the outset what features are necessary or even wanted in a new medium. The experimental phrase of early printing, when the texts we identify as incunabula were produced, lasted at least sixty years, which would place us well within the incunabula period for digital texts, at least as a popular medium. We should expect false starts and recursions.</p> <p>When Amazon released the Kindle, for example, it initially removed page numbers from its electronic books in favor of location numbers. The decision makes logical sense: what would a the skeuomorph of the page number even mean in a book that can be reconfigured on the fly as readers change the font, type size, and more? A Kindle book has no pages, so what good are page numbers? Soon, however, readers protested: particularly readers who wanted to share a book within a community, such as a classroom, in which different readers would access the book in different formats. Readers wanted to be on the same page, both literally and metaphorically, with readers in multiple modalities, and soon Amazon added page numbers back into Kindle books, though users can now toggle between page and location numbers. In classrooms, teachers and students alike are adapting to other ways of locating the same spot in a text, such as using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTR + F</code> to find a key word or phrase. Perhaps page numbers will eventually disappear entirely in favor of search, but it will be a slower process than Kindle designers, who did not consider the dependencies required for certain forms of communal reading, imagined.</p> <p>Liu’s essay reminds us that neat accounts of one media—or one technology—quickly and totally replacing a prior one are rarely true, or at least rarely so tidy. New media technologies shift an existing ecology, but old media persist practically, even spiritually. In 2021, analog technologies continue to shift and mutate alongside the computer, informing the evolution of computing—just as manuscript cultures mutated and thrived alongside while informing the evolution of print cultures. As Liu insists, “The <em>déjá vu</em> haunting of new by old media is clear enough.” Information scientists may not think of themselves as spiritualists or mediums, but they spend their professional lives immersed in haunted spaces, wrangling haunted machines. An ability to recognize, understand, sometimes call on, and sometimes consciously purge media dependencies can benefit information scientists enormously, both intellectually and practically. The goal of a dependencies framework for media history in information science is not nostalgia, but cultivating a richer technological imagination. We need information scientists who are not only able to use current media technologies, but who recognize the historical contingencies that led to this present; who are curious about the many branching paths that failed, were abandoned, or were actively foreclosed; and who can imagine more humane alternatives to our present that they can help create.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ryan Cordell</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While preparing to teach my spring graduate seminar, BookLab: Print to Programming, I’ve been thinking about why a student studying information science might want to take an experiential course at the intersection of book history, media studies and digital humanities. Writing several years ago in “How Not to Teach Digital Humanities”, I argued that DH practitioners should seek to “create versions of DH that make sense not at some ideal, universal level but at specific schools, in specific curricula, and with specific institutional partners.” I believed this when I was working in an English Department, and I continue to believe this now that I have moved to a School of Information Science. As such, it is incumbent on me to reconsider the frameworks of my teaching in light of new students with distinct skills, goals, and needs.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Spring 2022 Grad Seminar: Book Lab</title><link href="https://ryancordell.org/teaching/s22bl/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spring 2022 Grad Seminar: Book Lab"/><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://ryancordell.org/teaching/BookLabGradClass</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ryancordell.org/teaching/s22bl/"><![CDATA[<p>This spring I will offering an experiential book history-meets-DH graduate seminar in the iSchool at UofI. This class will be an updated version of my NU seminar <a href="https://s19rm.ryancordell.org/">Reading Machines</a>, adapted for the iSchool—though I still hope to have students from many units, including English and History.

Our approach will draw on scholarship in book history, bibliography, information science, media studies, and digital humanities, an intersection described by N. Katherine Hayles and Jessica Pressman as “comparative textual media.” We will take this comparative, interdisciplinary approach first to better understand machines of reading (from the printed book to computer code) as material, historical, and cultural objects. We will examine how practices of reading, writing, and publishing have interacted—thematically and materially—with contemporaneous technological innovations over the past 250 years. This cross-historical examination will open new modes of materially-engaged critique for our technological present.</p> <p>We will complement our readings with praxis, gaining hands-on experience  through critical making experiments using textual technologies from letterpress to zines to computer programming, as well as with archival materials from UIUC’s Rare Books and Manuscript Library. Together, weekly “book labs” and course discussions will help us consider relationships among modes of textual production, reception, and interpretation: including in our purview both “intellectual work,” such as writing, and “manual labor,” such as typesetting.</p> <p>Through our discussions we will develop greater capacities to critically read machines, analyzing the political, cultural, and social forces that shape—and are shaped by—textual technologies. We will raise urgent questions around privacy, algorithmic bias, intellectual property, information overload, and textual authority, asking how a rich new media history might inform our technological present and contribute to a richer construction of the digital humanities and information sciences fields.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Update (2021-12-10)</strong>: There’s now a syllabus for <a href="https://s22bl.ryancordell.org/">BookLab: Print to Programming</a> available!</p>]]></content><author><name>Ryan Cordell</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This spring I will offering an experiential book history-meets-DH graduate seminar in the iSchool at UofI.
