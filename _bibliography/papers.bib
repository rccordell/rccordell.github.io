  abstract = {In a review of Graham's Magazine published in the March 1, 1845 issue of The Broadway Journal, Edgar Allan Poe predicted of magazine literature, ``[i]n a few years its importance will be found to have increased in geometrical ratio'' because ``[t]he whole tendency of the age is Magazine-ward.'' Busy mid-century readers, speeding along in ``the rush of the age,'' required a medium that kept pace. ``We now demand the light artillery of the intellect,'' Poe insisted: ``we need the curt, the condensed, the pointed, the readily diffused \textendash{} in place of the verbose, the detailed, the voluminous, the inaccessible.''1 It can be difficult to pin down how seriously Poe took such declarations. Praise and ironic critique intertwine in his critical writings, as in subsequent paragraphs of this review, where he describes the engraving ``Dacota Woman and the Assiniboin Girl'' as ``worthy of all commendation,'' while another engraving in the same issue, ``The Love Letter,'' ``has the air of having been carved by a very small child, with a dull knife, from a raw potato.''2 If Poe marks a genuine trend toward periodical forms of literature in the period, he also stages an ambiguous response to the trend, vacillating between praise and condemnation.},

To adequately theorize any research conducted in large-scale text archives\textemdash including research that includes primary or secondary sources discovered through keyword search\textemdash we must avoid the myth of surrogacy proffered by page images and instead consider directly the text files they overlay. Focusing on the OCR (optical character recognition) from which most large-scale historical text data derives, this article argues that the results of this "automatic" process are in fact new editions of their source texts that offer unique insights into both the historical texts they remediate and the more recent era of their remediation. The constitution and provenance of digitized archives are, to some extent at least, knowable and describable. Just as details of type, ink, or paper, or paratext such as printer's records can help us establish the histories under which a printed book was created, details of format, interface, and even grant proposals can help us establish the histories of corpora created under conditions of mass digitization.},

The term “fugitive” shifted from referring to poems published to mark one specific occasion in time to those that demonstrate the serial, circulatory, and recursive temporality of newspaper publication and readership. Fugitive poems are fluid, adaptable for new contexts and audiences. They blend the literary with the informational, as the poems’ texts and authorship narratives interweave to appeal to readers. Like other species of newspaper texts, fugitive verses were preserved through circulation, and through dynamic interplays among the networks of writers, editors, and readers who composed, recomposed, excerpted, and remediated them in both newspapers and closely related media, such as scrapbooks.},

Speculative bibliography is offered as a complement to digital scholarly editing, and as a direct response to the challenges of scale and labour that will make comprehensive editing of digital archives impossible. Rather than acting on specific, individual texts, a speculative bibliography enacts a scholarly theory of the text through a computational model, reorganising the archive to evidence a particular idea of textual relation or interaction. Such models, in which textual relationships are determined by formal, internal textual structures, constitute bibliographic arguments that can be verified, amended, extended, or contested on either humanistic or computational grounds.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},
