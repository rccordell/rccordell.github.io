Even as ML methods have grown more powerful, nuanced, and sophisticated, ambitious hopes that ML might help better identify and describe vast library collections have been largely unmet, at least from the perspective of library patrons, researchers, and students. To address this gap, the article argues that libraries and ML researchers should work together to develop iterative, experimental, and even speculative interfaces that allow users to explore collections through ML-derived patterns that can enhance library data while educating users about ML processes, decisions, and biases.},

  abstract = {Although there exists a rich literature on data lifecycle, a common framework for data lifecycle depicts reuse as the last stage. However, this framework fails to explain the complex lifecycle of machine learning (ML) data sets, which can have many different afterlives. Data sets for ML can be expanded to supplement previous research, and researchers can concatenate multiple data sets to develop new models. This study discusses ML dataset reuse through the lens of the data--information--knowledge--wisdom pyramid. In social science research, researchers might reuse data to analyse a new research question that is still in the context of the data domain. By contrast, research practices in ML, where researchers layer multiple data sets for training purposes, require us to ask whether the existing data lifecycle model, ending with `reuse', is appropriate for explaining such an iterative and layered lifecycle. This study introduces one case of merging computer vision data set and natural language processing data set and two cases of applying ML models from outside of the ML community (hate speech detection and politeness detection) to justify a framework for a ML dataset lifecycle. Last but not least, this study proposes a ML dataset lifecycle and provides case examples to describe each stage.},

The digitization of historical texts invites researchers to explore the large-scale corpus of historical texts with computational methods. In this study, we present computational text analysis on a relatively understudied topic of how Asian workers are represented in historical newspapers in the United States. We found that the word "coolie" was semantically different in some States (e.g., Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Arkansas) with the different discourses around coolie. We also found that then-Confederate newspapers and then-Union newspapers formed distinctive discourses by measuring over-represented words. Newspapers from then-Confederate States associated coolie with slavery-related words. In addition, we found Asians were perceived to be inferior to European immigrants and subjected to the target of racism. This study contributes to supplementing the qualitative analysis of racism in the United States with quantitative discourse analysis.},

Busy mid-century readers, speeding along in ``the rush of the age,'' required a medium that kept pace. ``We now demand the light artillery of the intellect,'' Poe insisted: ``we need the curt, the condensed, the pointed, the readily diffused \textendash{} in place of the verbose, the detailed, the voluminous, the inaccessible.''1 It can be difficult to pin down how seriously Poe took such declarations. Praise and ironic critique intertwine in his critical writings, as in subsequent paragraphs of this review, where he describes the engraving ``Dacota Woman and the Assiniboin Girl'' as ``worthy of all commendation,'' while another engraving in the same issue, ``The Love Letter,'' ``has the air of having been carved by a very small child, with a dull knife, from a raw potato.''2 If Poe marks a genuine trend toward periodical forms of literature in the period, he also stages an ambiguous response to the trend, vacillating between praise and condemnation.},

To adequately theorize any research conducted in large-scale text archives\textemdash including research that includes primary or secondary sources discovered through keyword search\textemdash we must avoid the myth of surrogacy proffered by page images and instead consider directly the text files they overlay. Focusing on the OCR (optical character recognition) from which most large-scale historical text data derives, this article argues that the results of this "automatic" process are in fact new editions of their source texts that offer unique insights into both the historical texts they remediate and the more recent era of their remediation. The constitution and provenance of digitized archives are, to some extent at least, knowable and describable. Just as details of type, ink, or paper, or paratext such as printer's records can help us establish the histories under which a printed book was created, details of format, interface, and even grant proposals can help us establish the histories of corpora created under conditions of mass digitization.},

The term “fugitive” shifted from referring to poems published to mark one specific occasion in time to those that demonstrate the serial, circulatory, and recursive temporality of newspaper publication and readership. Fugitive poems are fluid, adaptable for new contexts and audiences. They blend the literary with the informational, as the poems’ texts and authorship narratives interweave to appeal to readers. Like other species of newspaper texts, fugitive verses were preserved through circulation, and through dynamic interplays among the networks of writers, editors, and readers who composed, recomposed, excerpted, and remediated them in both newspapers and closely related media, such as scrapbooks.},

  abstract = {Texts propagate through many social networks and provide evidence for their structure. We describe and evaluate efficient algorithms for detecting clusters of reused passages embedded within longer documents in large collections. We apply these techniques to two case studies: analyzing the culture of free reprinting in the nineteenth-century United States and the development of bills into legislation in the U.S. Congress. Using these divergent case studies, we evaluate both the efficiency of the approximate local text reuse detection methods and the accuracy of the results. These techniques allow us to explore how ideas spread, which ideas spread, and which subgroups shared ideas.},
