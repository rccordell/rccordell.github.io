One of those new colleagues is <a href="https://zoeleblanc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe LeBlanc</a>, who also started this fall. I‚Äôm a huge admirer of Zoe‚Äôs digital history research and pedgogy, and so am thrilled to be working with her to bolster the iSchool‚Äôs already-impressive offerings in digital humanities.</p> <p>The second most compelling inducement to the iSchool was the chance to work with students in a richly interdisciplinary department‚Äîstudents whose work perhaps sits somewhat awkwardly across academic departments, as mine does. Now that we‚Äôre tumbling headlong into fall, I know that many people are planning grad school applications and drafting their materials. A few days ago I posted <a href="https://twitter.com/ryancordell/status/1440701648121184271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a short Twitter thread</a> about how our pipelines to graduate school are so shuttered that students never consider programs where they might thrive, simply because they and their advisers are entirely unaware of those programs. In particular, I know there are many humanities students whose work, whether in digital humanities, critical bibliography, book history, or media studies‚Äîto cite only fields my work crosses‚Äîwould thrive in the iSchool, if they would only apply to a school with ‚ÄúInformation Sciences‚Äù in its name.</p> <p>Since Zoe and I are both new iSchool faculty looking for graduate students with whom we might work, we decided to write a brief post together, ‚ÄúWhy Should Humanities Students Consider an iSchool PhD?‚Äù which I‚Äôve republished in full below. When Zoe cross-posts <a href="https://zoeleblanc.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on her site</a> I will link to her version as well. This post is our call, in short, to those prospective iSchool students coming from humanities disciplines and compelled by questions of technology, media, and culture that are central to the iSchool‚Äôs curriculum.</p> <p>I would add to the general comments in our collaborative post that I‚Äôm particularly keen to hear from prospective Ph.D. students working on topics in book and periodical history (broadly construed), histories of text technologies (analog and digital), viral media and culture (likewise), and/or machine learning in digital libraries. In the most capacious possible terms, if you want to study how technologies of production, reception, remediation, and interpretation shape texts‚Äô meanings within historical communities, or how the complexities of historical texts pressure modern scholarly infrastructure, then I would love to hear from you.</p> <hr> <h2 id="why-should-humanities-students-consider-an-ischool-phd">Why Should Humanities Students Consider an iSchool PhD?</h2> <p><strong>By: <a href="https://ryancordell.org/">Ryan Cordell</a> and <a href="https://zoeleblanc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe LeBlanc</a></strong></p> <p>Have you ever wondered how we can use computers to study culture and the past? Are you interested in the intersection between humanities and information technology? Have you maybe heard of digital humanities (DH) and wondering what it might mean or how you might pursue further study in this area?</p> <p>Well if you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should consider applying to the Ph.D program at <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Information Sciences</a> (iSchool) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p> <p>Rooted in its long history as the #1 school for library and information sciences in the United States, the iSchool faculty are experts in a range of humanities subjects, including medieval history, historical newspapers, children‚Äôs literature, the history of genre, and computational approaches to culture. From the outside, ‚Äúinformation science‚Äù might sound like a branch of computer science. Though some of us like to code, we are also committed to studying how information technology‚Äîwhether codices or computers‚Äîshapes society and culture. For example, the iSchool offers courses and supports students working in:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/areas/archives-and-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Archives, Preservation, and Digital Curation</a>: information preservation, data curation, data provenance</li> <li> <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/areas/history-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The History of Information</a>: book history, bibliography, science and technology studies</li> <li><a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/areas/diversity-and-social-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diversity and Social Justice</a></li> <li> <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/areas/digital-humanities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Humanities</a> and <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/areas/digital-libraries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Libraries</a>: cultural analytics, distant reading, computational music analysis, digital history</li> <li> <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/areas/cultural-informatics-and-heritage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultural Informatics and Heritage</a>: community, cultural, and social informatics; information policy</li> <li><a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/areas/youth-literature-culture-and-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youth Literature, Culture, and Services</a></li> </ul> <p>What sets the iSchool apart is that we offer the opportunity to combine humanistic research with robust training in computational methods and systems that will prepare you for a unique career trajectory in our digital and data-driven society, whether in academia, nonprofits, the public sector, or beyond.</p> <p>We invite you to <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn about ongoing research projects at the iSchool</a>, <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/doctoral-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get to know our current PhD students</a>, <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/courses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explore our courses</a>, and to consider how your work might thrive in our interdisciplinary community. If we can help your decision-making, feel free to <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/graduate-interest-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request more information</a> (or contact professors you might work with directly).</p> <p>Students accepted to the iSchool‚Äôs Ph.D. program are guaranteed five years of funding in the form of research, teaching, and service assistantships, which include tuition waivers and stipends. We also offer travel support. When you‚Äôre ready, here‚Äôs where you can <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/phd-information-sciences/apply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review our requirements and apply</a>. We especially encourage applications from students from historically underrepresented minority groups.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> ¬© Copyright 2025 Ryan C.
